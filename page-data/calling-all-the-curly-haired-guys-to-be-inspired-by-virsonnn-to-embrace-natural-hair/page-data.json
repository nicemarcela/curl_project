He also talked about how his curly hair journey started thanks to social media and how he is giving back to the community <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/virsonnn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">on his Instagram</a> by sharing information, new products, styling methods, and do's and don'ts that helped him achieve his healthy curls.</p>\n<p>Virson also encourages all the curly guys out there to embrace their hair: \"Today it's not expected for a guy to have short hair, so why would you? Bring out the beautiful curls you have!\". Are you ready to start your journey? </p>\n<p><em>Keep scrolling to let Virson convince you</em> ⬇️  </p>\n<p><strong><em>How do you define yourself?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>I am someone who's driven and always in for new information. I love a good and deep conversation about any topic. From politics to beauty, you can name it.   </p>\n<p><strong><em>Can you talk in detail about your journey with your natural hair?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>I started growing my hair in 2015. At that moment there was a lot to find on social media, so that's also where my journey began. On social media! I live with my 'white' mom and she never knew/understood how curls work and how to nourish/grow them. Different from a lot of people, especially girls, I've never had a bad relationship with my hair. For me, it has always been a good and informative journey to get to the state my curls are in currently. Social media has been a perfect place to find out about new products, styling methods, and do's and don'ts. To this day I find out new information on social media. It makes me very happy that today I can be the place for a lot of people to find out information. So where I in 2015 had to go to people's Instagram for info, people check my page to find out the latest trends and I think that's amazing.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>How did you start as a content creator &#x26; influencer? Can you give some advice for those wanting to start in this industry?</em></strong>   </p>\n<p>A lot of people at work, when I walked the streets or on Social media itself, asked me what products I used and what products I would recommend. I always loved when someone would get back at me and tell me the advice I gave them helped them. So this is basically how I started sharing information on Social media myself. I love trying out new products, so why wouldn't I do it on Social media, so that other people could go off of my thoughts and try them or not try them out themselves?   </p>\n<p>If you want to start in this industry, make sure you're active. Posting pictures, videos, and stories every day is a must (I do lack this a lot of times tho...). Also having fun is the most important thing to have. If you don't it's gonna be a burden on your shoulders to post and share your thoughts.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>As a creative - Where would you say your inspiration comes from?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>Other content creators are my inspo for sure! I love checking out their IG pages and/or Youtube videos. Whenever I see someone make pictures in a type of way or use certain products, that always inspires me on how to take my pictures or what products I want to try out myself.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>How is it for you to be a curly influencer guy in a women-dominated industry? Have you had any kinds of difficulties related to your gender?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>I do have to say, yes... Because it is a woman-dominated industry, a lot of campaign searches for brand ambassadors, or pictures for ads, are focusing on women. There are a few 'big' curly influencer guys, and you see them in basically all the ads that are focusing on or including guys. So it is kind of hard as a guy to make yourself count as well. Still, a lot of brands use the term 'all curly girls', so sometimes as a curly guy you can feel left out. I do understand because the beauty industry is mainly used by women, so this is also where the money is. There are some brands though, that do include curly guys in their campaigns. Being a guy with long curly hair is seen as special and not necessarily normal, so I think that this is also a big issue for curly guys in this industry.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>Do you think the influencer industry has to change in terms of inclusivity? If yes, can you share your thoughts on it?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>I do think so, yes, but there is always room for improvement. Brands today are focussing more on 'all' hair types and not only type 3. But as I said before, there is still room for improvement. For example, using more curly guys as the face of a line/brand and not only girls.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>What advice would you give to men struggling to accept their curls instead of just shaving their heads?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>Just go for it! There are so many different styles to use. You can braid, do a wash and go or put in a pineapple. Today it's not expected for a guy to have short hair, so why would you? Bring out the beautiful curls you have!  </p>\n<p><strong><em>I guess everybody has some different techniques to get in the \"creation mood\". How do you put yourself in the mood to create? Do you have any special rituals or advice that help to get there?</em></strong>   </p>\n<p>Sometimes it's dragging and you think you're out of options and that you've had everything already. The thing that helps me the most is watching Youtube videos which will get me in the 'creation mood'. Also asking my friends and family what they would like to see. They are a good reflection of my followers' base.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>What do you consider the most important step when styling your hair?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>MOISTURE!! I also really want to feel that my hair has absorbed the products that I put in it.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>We all know it can be tricky to learn how to deal with our hair's texture. For you, what was/is the most difficult aspect of it? Why?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>My hair just changes a lot. So there's always a moment that I feel that products of a certain way of applying do not work for me anymore. So finding out what the problem is, is the hardest aspect of how to deal with my hair.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>What is the product/brand you recommend the most? Why?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>Curly Secret! They keep on expanding their line. This is something I need to not get tired of a certain brand/line. Also, the products smell amazing and it's a Black-Owned Business which I also always love to support!   </p>\n<p><strong><em>If someone starting their curly journey today, asked you for advice, what would you say?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>Don't compare your journey to someone else's!\nProducts that work for me might not work for you and vice versa. Go to your local hair shop, start comparing products and try to find your own story when it comes to your curls!  </p>\n<p><strong><em>Is there anything you would add that you think would be relevant for the community?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>Love your hair, it's God-given and beautiful in ANY way.   </p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CRHg9Filp71/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"13\" style=\" background:#FFF;

The main reason for this is, because, as most of us know, sulfates can make your curls dry. I do however use a sulfate shampoo once a month or once every five weeks, to get rid of all the build-up from the products that I have used the prior washdays. I also sometimes use a co-wash. A co-wash is the perfect outcome when your hair is still clean, but your scalp is all sweaty because of your workout, for example. My absolute favorite sulfate-free shampoo is the Jamaican Black Castor Oil Strengthen & Restore Shampoo from Shea Moisture. I shampoo my hair twice when I wash my hair. I do not use a certain sulfate shampoo every time I use one. So I just go with what I see on my shelf. A co-wash that I almost obsessively use is the Dry & Itchy co-wash from As I Am. This product contains olive and tea tree oil and is a perfect match for when you have a dry scalp. As I already mentioned before I wash my hair twice when I am in the shower. I also mainly focus on my scalp and rarely use shampoo on the length of my hair.","gallery":[{"image":{"publicURL":"/static/705396bf4ffd3288c52c205efe57eed1/SMjamaicanshampoo.jpg"},"productURL":"https://www.sheamoisture.com/jamaican-black-castor-oil-strengthen-and-restore-shampoo-16oz/764302215509.html"},{"image":{"publicURL":"/static/a3537965e8b0b67d3bd131bf0eac0e9a/asIamdryanditchy.jpg"},"productURL":"https://asiamnaturally.com/products/olive-tea-tree-oil-co-wash?variant=9318525632548"}]},"product2":{"title":"Conditioning","description":"Conditioning my hair takes the longest. I usually have to comb out my hair for 15-20 minutes in the shower. Just as the sulfate shampoo I did not find my go-to conditioner yet. I recently started using the Grapeseed Strengthening conditioner from Cantu and I am very positive about it. So if I have to give you one answer, this is my current favorite. As for my technique, I ALWAYS start with using my fingers as my comb. When you use finger detangling, you have control over what you are doing. After finger detangling, I always use a wide-tooth comb to get rid of all the little tangles my fingers could not get to.","gallery":[{"image":{"publicURL":"/static/db830e687e274c4dfa1e1a86ba01c454/cantugrapeseedconditioner.png"},"productURL":"https://www.amazon.com/Cantu-Grapeseed-Conditioner-Ounce-400ml/dp/B08K3QWRLJ"}]},"product3":{"title":"Styling","description":"Styling my hair is the most bipolar part of my hair routine. I receive a lot of products from different brands, so I never have the time to find out which products work best for me. I do usually go for a leave-in conditioner, a styling cream, and top it off with a gel. Lately, I have been using the products from Curly Secret and they work well for my curls. After applying the leave-in conditioner to my hair, I always use whatever brush I can find to distribute the product throughout my curls. I regularly apply the cream and scrunch in the gel.","gallery":[{"image":{"publicURL":"/static/9255d30f68dddb718c64f0b1d0647713/curlysecretleavein.png"},"productURL":"https://www.curlysecret.com/products/curl-reviving-leave-in"},{"image":{"publicURL":"/static/3f3611dfab08495e760a1b89c54ed94b/curlysecretmilk.png"},"productURL":"https://www.curlysecret.com/products/sweet-vanilla-hair-milk"},{"image":{"publicURL":"/static/ed67ebc3edada983ce9b11d4619aae11/curlysecretflaxseedsgel.png"},"productURL":"https://www.curlysecret.com/products/flaxseed-hemp-seed-styling-gel"}]},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/76313ed75339598c3070cd253a4c0edf/f422e/virson.jpg","srcSet":"/static/76313ed75339598c3070cd253a4c0edf/f836f/virson.jpg 200w,\n/static/76313ed75339598c3070cd253a4c0edf/2244e/virson.jpg 400w,\n/static/76313ed75339598c3070cd253a4c0edf/f422e/virson.jpg 640w","sizes":"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"calling-all-the-curly-haired-guys-to-be-inspired-by-virsonnn-to-embrace-natural-hair"}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454","979176408"]}
