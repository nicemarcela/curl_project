She is of Ghanian descent, both parents from Guinea Conakry. She defines herself as confident, and carefree. Henri is all about love, peace, unity, self-improvement, self-evolution, fashion &#x26; music, and about being multifaceted, owning who you are, going after your dreams, and being unapologetically yourself.  </p>\n<p>You can feel all of that and more on <a href=\"https://smarturl.it/HenriBPhases\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">her new project called Phases</a>. She talked with me about the many processes she has been through behind the creation of Phases, about boosting self-confidence through the power of affirmations, and of course, how to keep healthy hair when you are engaged in playing with different hairstyles!  </p>\n<p><em>Keep scrolling to find out</em> ⬇️</p>\n<p><strong><em>Can you talk a bit about your career as a musician? How did it start?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>I've always loved music, it started around the age of four or six, one of my favorite things to do was to write stories, I loved storytelling. There was a period in school where it was like drop everything and read or drop everything and write, and you're just in your own little world, in your zone, and I just loved storytelling! Fast forward to middle school, I still did it, I felt I was a loner in my middle school/high school days because I didn't go outside and play with a lot of people. So I was like \"if I can't be outdoors, I'll be indoors doing something productive that I love\". So I started writing more and more, I listened to people like Michael Jackson, Beyonce, and Rihanna, I just worked on my craft, and I feel like, shit that I was doing in elementary school, middle school, or high school, it leaves it up to who I am now. </p>\n<p>After school, I started writing more but I didn't really take it too seriously until my senior year because when you're getting into college and you're like, \"Okay, what am I about to do now?\". I knew I wanted to do business, I knew that I still wanted to do music, but I didn't know how passionate I was about it to take it as seriously. And finally, I thought \"You know what? Let me just do this shit\". And I feel like I took it seriously my freshman year in college. There was this one artist, r.i.p for her, her name was Brax and we were literally the same age, and I honestly feel like I saw myself in her, same traits, same qualities, same aesthetic, all of that. And she was doing the damn thing. In my mind, being in college was depressing at a point because I didn't want to be there. It wasn't fulfilling me, I was not happy, I was really depressed. And finally, something told me: \"go, just get up and do it\". So I just did it. Honestly, I just planned it and worked towards it. And now we're here. So I'd say I officially started taking music seriously in 2018.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Can you talk in detail about your project “PHASES”? Such as what was the inspiration, and how does it speak to yourself?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>The inspiration behind phases was events that led up to the starting of it. As I said, I started music in 2018 so around 2019, I started going through some shit, as far as finding out my voice as a woman in this male-dominated industry, because I went through a low mishap with an artist, and it just showed me that I had to speak up and find my voice. </p>\n<p>It's crazy because once that mishap happened, I didn't have music anymore. I couldn't retrieve my music, it was just done, it was over and I was in a situation where it was like \"What the fuck is going on?\". Phases started during the pandemic around June of 2020, and it's pretty much about a whole bunch of events that led up to the creation of \"Phases\", because when you're going through phases, you're going through a range of emotions, and situations, whether it's good or bad, we're just a bunch of shit. </p>\n<p>In one of the songs on the project release, I wrote that song because I was so fired up about the shit that I went through that I just had to talk big shit. It's me being transparent with myself and being honest and open with myself, and also being honest and open with my supporters. I feel like anytime that I create music, I want everyone to understand how I felt at that time. So, this is just me. This is just me releasing all of these emotions that were bottled in, and just speaking my truth.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Where do you look for inspiration when composing your music?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>Honestly, it's usually what I go through or my surroundings, it could be friends, my family, etc. I do want to get in the habit of not always talking about myself, but also watching movies and just pulling inspiration from different things. But when I look for inspiration, it's usually what I went through or what I go through, or what I want others to experience if that makes sense.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Did you doubt at any point that you were going to succeed in this industry? How did you deal with it?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>I think my doubt was before I started, honestly, I feel like I've always known that this was made for me, and to this day I have, and I'm undoubting. I just knew that once, whoever notices me and once I blow it's over for everybody. Like, I feel like when you know something is for you, you know when something is for you. There have been times where I was thinking maybe this is not for me before I even started this shit, I had all these what-ifs when I haven't even tried yet. Even with being dark-skinned, and reading about dark-skinned women in the industry and how they're not always praised or they're put in the backburner. It just, I don't know, I've had moments where I doubted myself, but I've always known that this music shit was for me, like, give me a budget and listen, I'll make magic, but as far as like dealing with it, it's a mental thing.  </p>\n<p>I feel like you can control your thoughts and emotions, I just had to reaffirm myself if no one did it, I was the one to reaffirm myself like \"you're built for this\", \"God gave you a gift\". It's only right to leave this earth knowing that you gave it your all and you did it. You did this shit. I always say this, I'd rather try and fail than not do it at all. So yeah, just dealing with it and reaffirming myself, like telling myself \"you're meant for this\". You're the chosen one. I really like feeding myself with positivity.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Can you share some tips with young black girls and WOC that are struggling to start/keep going on this path?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>Start working on your internal self. Start working on your mental, start affirming what you want with this life, what you want out of this shit, whether it's a million dollars, whatever it is, just reaffirming that you're going to get it and also putting in the actual work.  </p>\n<p>Are your affirmations and manifestations matching up and aligning with your work? This is not easy, being an independent artist and having to pay for certain shit and having to ride, it's a lot that comes to it. So you have to keep going, you have to believe that you are meant for this, it's a mindset thing. </p>\n<p>It's not for the weak because you chose to take on a career path that one in a \"who knows\" gets the chance to do. Work, work, work! I'm saying this, but I'm also talking to myself because there are moments where I procrastinate and don't always write or don't always have inspiration, but you just have to keep going. </p>\n<p>Recently, I watched Jay Cole's documentary and he was talking about finding inspiration. Because there will be times where you won't have inspiration. But that doesn't mean that you don't create, you just write right all the time. Write, write, write, write whether it's something really small as a poem or a haiku, just believe in yourself. Believe in yourself and visualize it, and once you see it and believe it's going to happen. God puts everything in you for a reason. Don't stop working on your grabs. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Do you have any special rituals to boost your self-confidence?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>Affirmations. Affirmations! Honestly, I think affirmations are the number one thing for me, but also just make sure that I look good as well because when you look good, you feel good, that's what helps. I look at myself in the mirror, the way I look at myself in the mirror you'd probably think I'm conceited as fuck, but I'm not. When you look at yourself in the mirror, like I'm doing right now, get cute, I'm that bitch. I'm that bitch so I look so good. Take pictures of yourself and just feed yourself with positive words.</p>\n<p><strong><em>As you’re always playing with hairstyles, do you have any special care for your natural hair?</em></strong>   </p>\n<p>Honestly, I try to keep my hair in a whole bunch of protective styles so that I don't have to deal with it. That's the truth. I'm still learning what works for my natural hair and what doesn't, because I do have a problem with dry hair, and shrinkage, it's so hard sometimes. I'm growing my hair out now just so I can see how long it gets. As far as special care I always have it in a protective hairstyle then I don't have to touch it or mess with it too much. But when it comes to washing and stuff, I'll put it in four sections, I use Shea Moisture and castor oil.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>What’s the role your hair plays in your personality?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>I feel like I'm a character so with hairstyles I can be whoever I want to be. I have days where I feel edgy, other days where I feel a lot of bohemian, other days it's giving Erykah Badu, it depends. This year I'm planning to play with more hair colors and more different styles. that's the role that my hair plays. I could be whoever I want to be.</p>\n<p><strong><em>You seem to be very comfortable with your body on social media, was it something you had to make peace with or you’ve always been okay with it?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>I've had to come to peace with my body. I don't know if you've seen the Chloe Bailey controversy, how people were like bashing her for showing skin and being herself. When she started over-explaining herself I felt that, because when I was growing up a lot of things were said about my body, I was a chubby little girl but ended up losing weight, but I feel it started at a young age. So I grew up very timid very cautious about my body and I felt like I was getting the wrong attention, from elementary school to part of high school, I was shy about it because I used to feel like I was fat or too small, in the past, I had a love and hate relationship with my body. So I had to grow to love it, seeing me posting on social media is just me being carefree and accepting myself, I'm settling into my grown woman body. I'm hot! I'm fire! </p>\n<p>Why not embrace what God gave you? As a woman your body is always going to change, it's going to evolve when you get pregnant, you get stretch marks, what I had to tell myself was \"love your body at every stage\", of course, if you're not comfortable with something on you, fix it! I'm not saying get plastic surgery, but work out, put in the work to change it. Working out is such a big part of me because it helped me to work for what I wanted as far as my image, I'm really big on the image. It took me years of learning myself and being honest with myself and just putting in the work. I've come to peace with it. So, just love yourself and be kind to yourself. I feel like we're all very critical of ourselves, we're our biggest enemy sometimes. So, it just took time.   </p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CRKQd2ilqbe/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"13\" style=\" background:#FFF;
