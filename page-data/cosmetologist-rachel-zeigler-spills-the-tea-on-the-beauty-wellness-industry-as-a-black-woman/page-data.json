She is passionate about the connection between beauty &#x26; wellness as she strongly believes that when you make time to care for yourself it enhances your wellness, boosts your mood, and because let’s face it: When you look good you feel good!</p>\n<p>Rachel is the founder of Naked Chemistry, a skincare brand that creates effective, vegan, and sustainable products that help to alleviate, prevent and heal ingrown hairs for all.</p>\n<p><em>Keep reading our talk</em>, other than haircare we also discussed inclusivity, and the non-beauty part of the beauty industry.⬇️    </p>\n<p><strong><em>In a few words, how do you define yourself?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>I would define myself as a multi-hyphen creative with a passion for living free!  </p>\n<p><strong><em>How long have you been natural? Can you go into detail about your natural hair journey?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>I have been natural since 2013. It was life-changing and freeing as a black woman. Having long, controlled straight hair all my life and now have a short, kinky curly afro. It was shocking to some and even myself but it was liberating freedom. It was a way for me to get in touch with myself, and boost my self-confidence without falling into the “norm”.   </p>\n<p><strong><em>How is it to work in the beauty and wellness industry as a Black woman?</em></strong>   </p>\n<p>Working in the beauty and wellness industry as a black woman you can see some things up close, like sets not having products for all hair types, or stylists being unable or unwilling to work on textured hair. You notice little things that make you feel left out as a black woman. There's also a lack of representation for kinkier curls which makes you feel left out if you DO not have the status quo “wet and wavy” hair that is commonly displayed. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Do you think your natural hair, has represented any kind of difficulty in this industry?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>My natural hair makes a statement, I use to work on sets and I know that when the black models saw me they knew they would be in good hands, they knew they didn’t have to worry about looking crazy because I was there, and I think that is something that should be standardized in the beauty industry: ONLY well-versed and experienced stylist should be on sets. There should be no reason why a woman of color or texture should be worried about being styled correctly!  </p>\n<p><strong><em>How do you feel about inclusivity within the beauty industry?</em></strong>   </p>\n<p>I feel like the beauty industry is actively working to do better but still needs A LOT of work. It needs more diversity in the stylist they hire for big sets, for the textures they choose to glamorize, to the idea of beauty they are trying to display. ALL of it can be improved and that starts with hiring people of color in those leading roles to ensure all needs are met and inclusivity is ALWAYS happening.</p>\n<p><strong><em>What are some brands that you think are just killing it, with being inclusive?</em></strong>   </p>\n<p>Of course Fenty Beauty… Rihanna broke the mode and does an amazing job of including and making all feel seen!  </p>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-img-attributes\" style=\"display:inline-block; width: 60%;margin:  0 auto;border-radius: 50px;\"><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 560px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/ccf1b385d9ca453bed7c6961ba1cec3b/b06ae/rachel2.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 125.15337423312883%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"rachel2\"\n        title=\"rachel2\"\n        src=\"/static/ccf1b385d9ca453bed7c6961ba1cec3b/b06ae/rachel2.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/ccf1b385d9ca453bed7c6961ba1cec3b/222b7/rachel2.png 163w,\n/static/ccf1b385d9ca453bed7c6961ba1cec3b/ff46a/rachel2.png 325w,\n/static/ccf1b385d9ca453bed7c6961ba1cec3b/b06ae/rachel2.png 560w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      / >\n  </a>\n    </span></span>  </p>\n<p><strong><em>What was the motivation to start Naked Chemistry?</em></strong>   </p>\n<p>As a licensed cosmetologist, I noticed the lack of effective and clean skincare products that helped to prevent, heal and alleviate ingrown hairs. Either they didn’t work or they were too harsh and dried out your skin. I felt like nothing took care of my concerns such as dry skin, dark spots, and prevention. So I hoped in the lab and began to formulate and test my formulas!  </p>\n<p><strong><em>I personally suffer a lot with ingrown hair and find it very painful to try out new products because most of the time they simply don't work. So there's a whole expectancy that's never met... How is it different in Naked Chemistry products?</em></strong>   </p>\n<p>Great question, the difference is:<br>\n1 - it was created by a beauty pro who studied holistic beauty, who researched every ingredient, and found the purpose behind it.\n2 - It is vegan, clean and sustainable, and lastly…it WORKS! Just try it! You will tell the difference! </p>\n<p><strong><em>How important you think eco-friendliness is in your products/the beauty industry?</em></strong>   </p>\n<p>SO IMPORTANT! Beauty Containers &#x26; beauty packaging make up a major portion of municipal solid waste (MSW), amounting to over 80.1 million tons of generation per year and growing every day and we ONLY have 1 planet, so doing our part to protect it is crucial! We also use glass containers and offer recycling rewards to our customers to promote repurposing of our empties!  </p>\n<p><strong><em>What do you consider the most important step when styling your hair?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>Cleansing! Ensure your scalp is cleansed and all old products are removed.   </p>\n<p><strong><em>We all know it can be tricky to learn how to deal with our hair's texture. For you, what was the most difficult aspect of it? Why?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>Accepting it! I used to wear relaxers for years. So just embracing my natural texture and being okay with it was a more difficult aspect than learning how to care for it and how to nourish it! Wow... So many learning curves in that process... Especially being a black woman with a tighter curl texture!   </p>\n<p><strong><em>What is the product/brand you recommend the most?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>I love Avocurl because it is natural, black-owned, and effective!   </p>\n<p><strong><em>A piece of advice from Rachel:</em></strong>        </p>\n<p>Treat your hair with love! Deep condition it, love it, be patient with it, and enjoy the journey! </p>","frontmatter":{"linkURL":"https://www.instagram.com/nicemarcela/","instaURL":"https://www.instagram.com/RachelZeigler_/","title":"Cosmetologist Rachel Zeigler spills the tea on the beauty & wellness industry as a black woman.","type":"Hair Type: 4A/4B/4C","author":"@nicemarcela","instagrammer":"@RachelZeigler_","date":"Apr 17th 2021","product1":{"title":"Cleansing","description":"I use so many different things...
