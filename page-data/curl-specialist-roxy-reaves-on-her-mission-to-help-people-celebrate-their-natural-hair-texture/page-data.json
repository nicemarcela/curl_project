She is a curl specialist, and transitioned from tech to beauty in the past few years ‚Äî \"I officially left tech to investigate how I could revolutionize the salon experience to be more sustainable and inclusive for folks with curls\" she says.  </p>\n<p>That's how Coastal Curl was born, with the mission to help people celebrate their natural hair texture, and achieve greater harmony within themselves and with the world around them. When Roxy isn't taking care of beautiful hair and inspiring folks to embrace their natural hair texture, you can find her spending time with her BIG bunny, named Boba. ü•∞üê∞ </p>\n<p>If you‚Äôre wondering about what products make the cut in this curl specialist hair regimen, we‚Äôve got you covered. In our talk, she dished on everything from her beauty routines. Keep scrolling to get to know Roxy Reaves and Coastal Curl. üåº  </p>\n<p><strong><em>How did Coastal Curl start?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>The idea for Coastal Curl got its start during my last year of college after I got my first ‚Äúreal job‚Äù and was navigating transitioning my hair to natural while also transitioning into the workplace. To be honest, I had a harder time finding a reliable stylist (or hair mentor as I like to call them) than a professional mentor to guide me in tech. After two years and countless bad salon experiences, I got up the nerve to start my own hair salon brand ‚Äî Coastal Curl. </p>\n<p>Many of us have grown up with the idea that we weren‚Äôt born with ‚Äúgood hair‚Äù ‚Äî a message subliminally reinforced in the media and often explicitly reinforced through the people closest to us ‚Äî and that‚Äôs a sentiment that comes from a place of ignorance or lack of knowledge about how to care for textured hair. </p>\n<p>I was one of those people who grew up from a young age believing I had bad, unruly, undesirable hair. The process of having it ‚Äútamed‚Äù was often expensive, frustrating, inconvenient, and even demeaning at times. </p>\n<p>Coastal Curl to me is the anti-that. It‚Äôs the utmost respect for the curl ‚Äî it‚Äôs scientifically informed, environmentally mindful, and starts with demystifying curl care by creating a better ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù salon experience that starts with folks being SEEN and HEARD. </p>\n<p><strong><em>What was the turning point for you to go from technology to beauty?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>Well, I finished my degree at Stanford, but after college, I spent a few years working as a digital marketer. Throughout that time I became increasingly frustrated by countless bad experiences and very limited salon options for natural hair in the Bay Area.</p>\n<p>So In 2018, I officially left tech to investigate how I could revolutionize the salon experience to be more sustainable and inclusive for folks with curls. </p>\n<p>I ended up founding my first company, Coastal Curl, with the mission to help people embrace/celebrate their natural hair texture, and achieve greater harmony within themselves and with the world around them.</p>\n<p>Right now it offers what I call a virtual-to-physical ‚Äúhybrid salon experience‚Äù ‚Äî mobile styling and online expert advice/access to all the products + things you might need to help your waves/kinks/coils thrive. Soon I‚Äôll also have a brick-and-mortar salon space to help fully bridge the gap between professional services and home care. </p>\n<p><strong><em>When did you realize you could actually help people embrace their natural hair texture?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>Something really funny happened two years into my natural hair journey. My favorite childhood hairstylist ‚Äî the woman who had taught me everything about my black hair and had been helping me tame my curls since I was a little girl ‚Äî asked ME for advice for styling curls. While she was an expert in silk presses and weaves, she had never really learned a solid wash-and-go styling technique and looked to me and my newly healthy curls for guidance! That‚Äôs when I knew I had gained enough knowledge to offer and make a difference in others' hair journeys. </p>\n<p><strong><em>What do you consider the most important step when styling your hair?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>I think the most important step for my bleached, dry, high-porosity curly hair is to generously apply my styling products in the shower while my hair is still completely fully soaked. This allows the curl clumps to form, and preserves a hydrated and defined look!   </p>\n<p><strong><em>What was the most difficult aspect of learning how to deal with your hair texture?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>It was accepting that it didn't need to look \"perfect\" and \"put together\" every day. The beauty of my curls is that they are dynamic, always changing, and a little messy... a.k.a. a lot like ME! Once I got over the mental hurdle of striving for that bone-straight, slick \"not a hair out of place\" look, and realized that my hair didn't DEFINE me, I was able to accept and work with the texture so much easier. I embraced it, understood it, and mastered it. </p>\n<p><strong><em>What is the product/brand you recommend the most?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>As a stylist, I work with a lot of different hair textures and curl patterns. The product I end up recommending most to my clients transitioning from heat-styling their hair is the Bounce Curl Ayurvedic Deep Conditioner. It is great for all curl types, it detangles hair like a dream, and it's equally both moisturizing and protein-izing for damaged curls.  </p>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-img-attributes\" style=\"display:block; width: 50%;margin:  0 auto;border-radius: 50px;\"><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 650px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/64f485cf2372288bbd4404917f6e696b/bf433/roxyy.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"roxyy\"\n        title=\"roxyy\"\n        src=\"/static/64f485cf2372288bbd4404917f6e696b/a6d36/roxyy.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/64f485cf2372288bbd4404917f6e696b/222b7/roxyy.png 163w,\n/static/64f485cf2372288bbd4404917f6e696b/ff46a/roxyy.png 325w,\n/static/64f485cf2372288bbd4404917f6e696b/a6d36/roxyy.png 650w,\n/static/64f485cf2372288bbd4404917f6e696b/bf433/roxyy.png 971w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      / >\n  </a>\n    </span></span></p>\n<p><strong><em>A piece of advice from Roxy:</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>\"Health is wealth.

Lately, twice a week (Saturday/Wednesday) I have been using the CurlMix Fragrance Free Aloe Vera Shampoo to cleanse my hair. I have added a few drops of my own essential oils (tea tree, peppermint) to customize it to my needs. I apply about a tablespoon dollup and apply it directly to my scalp after soaking my hair in warm water, and the massage it into my roots thoroughly before rinsing.","gallery":[{"image":{"publicURL":"/static/a405aee6e740bfa3da4a22d8bdf0196c/curlmixshampoo.jpg"},"productURL":"https://www.curlmix.com/products/pure-aloe-vera-shampoo-fragrance-free?variant=16027949170778"}]},"product2":{"title":"Conditioning","description":"Next, I alternate between a regular rinse-out conditioner (Curlmix Fragrance Free Grapeseed Conditioner) or a deep conditioner (BounceCurl Ayurvedic Deep Conditioner). Again, twice a week after shampooing I will follow up with one of these two conditioners and let it sit in my hair for at least 5-10 minutes while I scrub, shave, or just luxuriate in the bath. During this time I also section my hair and gently detangle with either my fingers or a wide tooth comb, before rinsing the conditioner out.","gallery":[{"image":{"publicURL":"/static/73005cd799bb4ecd9b53c3e117ac5975/curlmixconditioner.jpg"},"productURL":"https://www.curlmix.com/products/pure-grape-seed-conditioner-with-ultra-slip-and-fragrance-free?variant=16028042723418"},{"image":{"publicURL":"/static/7cb4fef369dec2900c0569028d86798d/bouncecurlayurvedicdc.png"},"productURL":"https://www.bouncecurl.com/products/ayurvedic-deep-conditioner"}]},"product3":{"title":"Styling","description":"This varies so much! For a classic wash-and-go, I like to layer the Curlmix Avocado Moisturizer and Flax Seed Gel. Again, I apply it in the shower after squeezing out a little bit of water, then I section my hair and apply the Avocado Moisturizer first, then layer the Flax Seed Gel over the sections using the prayer hands method. After applying the product, I scrunch the curls a bit, then wrap my hair in an old cotton t-shirt to absorb the excess moisture for a few minutes while I lotion my body and apply my AM skincare. Then, after about 10-15 minutes, I dry my hair until almost fully dry using a diffuser on medium heat/air. Then all it takes is a few scrunches to get it to peak big bouncy hair goals!","gallery":[{"image":{"publicURL":"/static/560537b52ed3e796f3fcfd411aef8e5d/curlmixmoisturizer.jpg"},"productURL":"https://www.curlmix.com/products/pure-avocado-moisturizer-with-organic-jojoba-oil-for-moisturizing-hair-lavender-fragrance?variant=8024777916446"},{"image":{"publicURL":"/static/85d813e85a7ec8b4ec2b7e537bd33f19/curlmixgel.jpg"},"productURL":"https://www.curlmix.com/products/pure-flaxseed-gel-with-jojoba-oil-for-moisturizing-hair?variant=6383781019678"}]},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/dbd8ec445e8a2aeb71566c6633f5de00/ee604/roxy.png","srcSet":"/static/dbd8ec445e8a2aeb71566c6633f5de00/69585/roxy.png 200w,\n/static/dbd8ec445e8a2aeb71566c6633f5de00/497c6/roxy.png 400w,\n/static/dbd8ec445e8a2aeb71566c6633f5de00/ee604/roxy.png 800w,\n/static/dbd8ec445e8a2aeb71566c6633f5de00/05d05/roxy.png 1080w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"curl-specialist-roxy-reaves-on-her-mission-to-help-people-celebrate-their-natural-hair-texture"}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454","979176408"]}
