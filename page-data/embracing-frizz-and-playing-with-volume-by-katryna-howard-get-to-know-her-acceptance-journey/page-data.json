Her natural hair is also part of this acceptance journey, as she states:</p>\n<p>\"Believe it or not, I did not always have a healthy relationship with my natural hair.⁣⁣\n⁣⁣Growing up, I only wore my hair in braids or straight &#x26; freshly pressed (𝘯𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳 𝘱𝘦𝘳𝘮𝘦𝘥 𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘯 𝘵𝘩𝘰𝘶𝘨𝘩 𝘐 𝘣𝘦𝘨𝘨𝘦𝘥, 𝘸𝘩𝘦𝘸... - 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘯𝘬𝘴 𝘮𝘰𝘮). My hair could barely hold a wave.<br>\nThere was a time I got pushed into the pool by another girl at summer camp and I came out crying because my straight hair was no longer straight and my natural hair was so foreign to me. I immediately attempted to re-straighten it all over again. Isn’t it crazy how societal standards of beauty can impact us as kids so early on? Fast forward to college, I went an entire year without adding heat to my hair and didn’t look back.⁣⁣</p>\n<p>Love your crown. It’s a 𝘤𝘰𝘯𝘵𝘪𝘯𝘶𝘰𝘶𝘴 journey.\"</p>\n<p>She is also releasing a project that talks about the experiences of black and brown womxn. It is a community that empowers, inspires, and unsettle the already established notion of community for black and brown womxn...for us, by us.

I'm all for getting my day 1 wash 'n go hair down RIGHT so I can extend them curls into day 2-5 hair, more volume each day w/o worrying about restyling.\"</p>\n<p>The most difficult aspect of when Kat, <em>and the majority of us</em>, was learning to love her natural hair was understanding it's normal to have different textures across our curly heads:  </p>\n<p>\"I used to be disappointed that my hair didn't all look the same texture and be impatient when having to cater to different areas differently. I.e: The hair along my hairline tends to frizz more and a central piece at the top back middle of my hair feels way more dry/undefined. I learned to put extra TLC into these areas when deep conditioning and styling and appreciating the depth of my genetics and kinky texture. </p>\n<p><em>A trick I love is finger coiling around my hairline to help tame those areas and going into day 3-4 hair. Or picking my hair into a fro to embrace a less put together, fro loving look.</em>\"</p>\n<h5>Innersense is the brand she recommends the most:</h5>\n<p>\"Because they are clean products that I've tested that work really well and are buildable with my hair. Being conscious and intentional with clean/organic ingredients is something I'd like to learn more about.\nAs well as Rizos curls, it's Latina made/owned and you get alot of product for your money. I prioritize being intentional with supporting Black/Brown/Women-owned businesses whenever possible, they are slowly being carried in accessible stores like Target.\"</p>\n<h5>Her styling go-to's:</h5>\n<p>Since eliminating DevaCurl from my routine about 8 months ago now, my go tos have been: </p>\n<p> * Kinky Curly Knot Today leave-in<br>\n* Innersense Quiet Curl Cream<br>\n* Innersense I create hold gel or Eco style gel black castor oil + flax seed<br>\n* to refresh curls: water/ Rizos Curls spray / Olaplex bonding oil  </p>\n<p>I sometimes switch out the above products with:<br>\n* Rizos Curls Curl Defining Cream<br>\n* Pattern leave-in, strong hold gel, Curl Cream<br>\n* Recently I have also been loving Rizos Curls Flexi detangling brush, it actually works really well with my hair, unlike a Denman brush.   </p>\n<h5>A piece of advice from Katryna:</h5>\n<p><em>\"We are so multifaceted and our relationship with our hair is not our entirety. Take a chance on experimenting with what works for you and don't be afraid to ask for help or get curious by asking questions from people in your circle. Do not shy from big hair, keep a pick on you always to play with that volume sis! Frizz isn't a bad thing.\"</em></p>\n<p>Make sure to give her a follow and inspire yourself with her lovely and empowering journey on Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/katt_daddy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@katt_daddy</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"linkURL":"https://www.instagram.com/katt_daddy/","title":"Embracing FRIZZ and playing with VOLUME by Katryna Howard.
