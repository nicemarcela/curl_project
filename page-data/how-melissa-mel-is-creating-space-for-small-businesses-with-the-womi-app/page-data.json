Melissa's goal is to create a space to explore brands and discover small businesses to support, that it becomes easier and more habitual to replace the larger and big box brands with small brands and to incorporate intentional shopping into more of our everyday shopping habits. She affirms this is not a trend, shopping small is a lifestyle! </p>\n<p><strong><em>Tell us about your background and where you are now?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>I'm originally from New Haven, Connecticut. I spent most of my life there and right now, I'm living in Los Angeles, California. I moved out here in 2018 and I have lived kind of all over. I've had five addresses since I've been here. I am here for the sun and I would not think of anywhere else that I could soak up the sun and be inspired by the beach, the views, and the vibe.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>Can you talk in detail about the WoMi app? Such as how did it start, what was your motivation/inspiration?</em></strong>   </p>\n<p>So, the WoMi app was an evolution of an Instagram series that I started. In my first six months of living in California, I met so many black and brown entrepreneurs, podcasters, and brand moguls. It was really inspiring to see so many entrepreneurs killing it, and in doing so for the fun, and for the passion of what they were creating. So I was moved and inspired to use that little platform that I had to shout these businesses out and tell people about them, get them some more support and visibility.  </p>\n<p>So at the beginning of 2019, I started a weekly Instagram stories shout out series, where I would buy and give my opinion and reviews of small businesses owned by women and minorities and I started by my friends' group, the more I shout out brands on Instagram and online, the more I knew I had found a leg of my purpose in creating content and providing a platform to small businesses. The response was overwhelmingly positive, and I found myself being okay with losing sleep creating this kind of content, which I cannot say about anything else that I was doing.  </p>\n<p>I kept with it, I did a shout out every single Wednesday, in the summer I expanded to doing IGTV interviews with local LA brands, and then in 2020 I have run out of room in my highlights, and I had tried organizing them to make them shoppable, organizing them by industry, so I had highlights for makeup, apparel brands,  but I run out of room so I started to think what was the next step for WoMi, \"what now?\".  </p>\n<p>So, I found out about a no-code app building platform and within 4 months we launched WoMi in Google Play and App Store, where you can browse women and minorities-owned brands by the industry, founder, different processes that they use, and by their location.\nToday we have over 600 app downloads, over 170 brands listed in the app, and you can connect right to their online shops and socials.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>I LOVE the idea of creating a space for small businesses, women, and minorities! Can you share some thoughts on that?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>Last year we saw this urge of supporting small business because we saw the direct impact of not being able to go outside and supporting them in their physical spaces, and not being able to spend as much on brands vs what we could find in stores, we went so much into a survival mode that small brands began to suffer, that was when this really big movement to support small brands began. But that is not a trend, shopping small is a lifestyle. I wanted to create a space to explore so many brands and discover small businesses to support, that it becomes easier and more habitual to replace the larger and big box brands with small brands and to incorporate intentional shopping into more of our everyday shopping habits. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Do you have any advice for staying creative?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>That's a tough one. Because I struggle with this a lot myself, and I don't know any creative person who at one point or another does fall into a kind of creative drought or funk, where it's hard or difficult to stay inspired and motivate yourself to create and put so much of yourself into work, that is emotional and genuine.  </p>\n<p>So I would say just take as many braces as you need and prioritize your mental health and your mind. Because that needs to be in a state that is conducive to being creative and either to respond to what you're going through or creating out of a place of peace and being able to be freely expressive. So, just find a pace that works for you and give yourself grace, be easy on yourself. Creatives have a very different way of working, living, and thriving, just give yourself the grace to figure out what that rhythm is for you.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>I saw that you're involved in many projects. Can you give some insights on how you organize yourself to have time for all of them? Do you have any tips or rituals to stay focused on?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>Organizing myself and time management is something I struggle with every day. The only tip I can give involves avoiding getting burned out. That's something I quickly approached with the launch of the app. I spent 4 months of late nights and overnights, stressing and not eating right to get it all done on time, and it burned me right out. I completely shut down and I had to re-organize how I did things to not forget myself and myself care and take care of my body in the process. So avoid burnout at all costs, treat your body well, you need to put good nutrition and good energy into it, so that you can properly run and keep up with all the things you have going on.  </p>\n<p>I take breaks as often as I need: at the end of every day, at the end of every hour, I'm my biggest priority. If I feel overwhelmed or if there's too much going on, I know I need to reorganize what’s on my plate, prioritize myself and what I feel good about doing. I'm continuously drawn to paying attention to what I'm avoiding, and trying to figure out why that is, and see if I can address the root of that vs just avoiding what I'm doing and procrastinating.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>Can you talk a bit about your journey with your natural hair and summarize some things you’ve learned since then?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>I grew up with really long and soft hair, in kindergarten it was passing my butt, and it was at that point very healthy. I honestly blame bangs for introducing me to processes like blow drying, flat ironing, and gel. Growing out bangs is a nightmare so I would always gel down my hair, and then started doing a lot of ponytails.  </p>\n<p>I just didn't have for most of my life what I would consider healthy or manageable hair, it has always been a struggle to retain moisture, to style, I've had a love-hate relationship with my baby hairs for years. My hair has always been a struggle to me, to feel beautiful and confident in whatever hairstyles I was rocking.  </p>\n<p>I went through a lot of different cuts, I've had long hair, bobs, and I had had mostly a buzz cut, it's like just a rectangle of hair on the top of my head, that I could wear to either side or up, and it was simple to style. But until then, I had just really focused on ease, and never really saw the full potential of my curls to be able to embrace them until I discovered Rizo's curls, which wasn't until I moved to L.A., which is wild.  </p>\n<p>I hadn't found any products built with intentions behind them, and I wasn't intentionally looking at what I was putting into my hair. So, with Rizo's curls, I found my natural curl pattern, I saw the full potential of my curls, and I’m just so in love with the journey of being able to embrace my natural hair.  </p>\n<p>I’ve been heat-free for quite a while, mostly because I was completely bald for a good amount of time in quarantine, but I've since learned that what I eat, how much I hydrate, and how often I do my haircare routine, have such a big impact on how my curls actually curl, and how my curl pattern flourishes. I've definitely learned a lot about the texture of my hair, so I'm just embracing my natural wild curls and just really protecting the curl texture as much as I can without heat or damaging processes.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>I saw on your Instagram that you've shaved your head, how was the experience? Do you have any goals for your hair atm, such as length goals?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>Shaving my head was an incredibly liberating experience. It was 100% out of efficiency and I didn't want to do my hair anymore. And when I came out to LA the barbers out here kind of really messed up my hairline, and kept pushing my baby hairs further back. So the only way to fix that was to go completely bald. I had toyed around with the idea, for months before I finally had someone, literally hold my hand through the tears, as they shave my head, and once they did, I took a look in the mirror and I was like, holy shit I love this. This looks bomb. I have the head for it, the face for it.  </p>\n<p>I rocked that for a while and it was a really freaking experience to be able to embrace the masculine side of my look and feel without any curls. I was worried about losing my femininity but I completely embraced both the feminine and masculine parts of rocking my shaved head. And right now, my goal is just to get my hair down to chin length so I can get back to my favorite haircut, which was the sides and back buzz with just a little rectangle hair on the top of my head. It was really distinctive and really low maintenance, and I want to get back to having that effortless iconic look.   </p>\n<p><strong><em>What do you consider the most important step when styling your hair?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>Defining my curls, whether with defining cream or gel, to avoid a static-y look.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>We all know it can be tricky to learn how to deal with our hair's texture. For you, what was/is the most difficult aspect of it?</em></strong>   </p>\n<p>The fact that my head has so many different textures of hair - even if one part is thriving &#x26; lookin cute that day, two others aren't. It can feel a little \"if it's not one thing it's another\" in achieving the desired look.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>What is the product / brand you recommend the most?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>Rizos Curls saved my curls! I swear by all their products &#x26; brand as a whole.
