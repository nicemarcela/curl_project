She aims to fill the lack of representation in this industry as a black natural hair/beauty influencer who has albinism. She is breaking the cycle of stigma and discrimination around albinism by putting herself out there, empowering, openly discussing, and demystifying it.  </p>\n<p>She is a positive role model to young people trying to fit and find representation online as she did when she was younger, she states: \"I just feel like there’s a young girl out there that looks like me wondering \"where are the people that look like me?\". This is why I do what I do, I don’t want them to feel how I felt when I was younger\". </p>\n<p>She also has a <a href=\"https://iyanalesheaillustrations.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">clothing brand, Iyana Le'Shea Illustrations,</a> that sells original black art created by hand to make you feel empowered, encouraged, and inspired. </p>\n<p>In our talk, she told me about the challenges of accepting herself and her natural hair, as she always felt \"different\", how she left that in the past and decided to don't give power to haters while striving to be great and working hard towards achieving some of the goals she set in place as a creative.  </p>\n<p><em>Continue reading</em> ⬇️   </p>\n<p><strong><em>In a few words, how do you define yourself?</em></strong></p>\n<p>I would have to describe myself as a go-getter someone determined to get something done when she says she’s going to get it done. An educated smart black woman who is a creative individual with my own style.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>Tell us about your background and where you are now?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>A little bit about me: I was born in Macon, Georgia then moved to Atlanta when I was about 4 years old. I have always been interested in art and all-around creating. I actually tried to start a YouTube channel at 16 just talking about my art but unfortunately, I didn’t go through with it because of my lack of confidence.<br>\nAs for where I am now, I decided to start my YouTube back in 2018 to fill the lack of representation. I definitely wanted to fill that space of being a black natural hair/beauty influencer who has albinism because it was difficult for me not to see or being influenced in that space as a black woman. I am currently striving to be great and working hard towards achieving some of the goals I have set in place as a creative.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>How is that for you to be black and have albinism? Was it something you had to make peace with?</em></strong>    </p>\n<p>When I was younger I was very insecure especially because I looked \"different\". I got picked on a lot in elementary. Once I got in my last year of high school something in me clicked and I start to not care about what other people’s opinions or thoughts about me were. I started to love and learn who I was as a black woman with Albinism so late no one can come to me and tell me otherwise. Albinism is still not understood crazy enough in 2021 so I had to make peace with knowing that. But as long as I, Iyana, know that I am a black woman that’s all the peace I need within myself.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>How important was it for you when you were younger to see black people with albinism out there in the media?</em></strong>    </p>\n<p>I feel it is extremely important to have representation of people that are black with albinism in media. When I was younger there weren’t a lot of people in media or even on social media that looked like me so it was a little difficult for me. I didn’t know who I was and I was confused, I was like: \"Well, I’m black but I’m not included in this, I’m not included in that, because I didn’t “look black”. The things that I do now are because I still see my 16-year-old self wondering where are the people that look like me. I just feel like there’s a young girl out there that looks like me wondering \"where are the people that look like me?\", this is why I do what I do I don’t want them to feel how I felt when I was younger.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>How do you deal with people on social media that send you hate? Do you feel any type of social media pressure?</em></strong>   </p>\n<p>I was born with tough skin. I had to have tough skin especially when I was younger because people would and still do pick on me because of my albinism, it is what it is. But on social media, it is just a simple block and delete. People would be hating just because they have the free time, they’re jealous or insecure whatever their issues may be but that definitely does not get to me. One thing my mom says is don’t ever let anybody have so much power over you that they will mess up your whole day so I won’t give the haters that power. </p>\n<p>As for feeling pressure on social media, I can say yes and no. I feel like the pressure comes mainly from myself because I am striving to push myself and put myself out there to be the representation of a black woman with albinism. After all, you just don’t really see that. I know I definitely didn’t see that at all when I was 16 back in 2012 so it can be overwhelming sometimes.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>As a woman of color in the influencer industry, have you ever faced any issues or challenges?</em></strong>   </p>\n<p>Most brands that I have worked with so far are open to including me, a black woman with albinism, so I haven’t really faced any major issues or challenges as of yet.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>As a digital creator and illustrator, how do you action your ideas?</em></strong>   </p>\n<p>I usually will first sit down and brainstorm, gathering inspiration online such as Pinterest. Pinterest is my favorite app of all time for getting inspiration and getting inspired. I will usually gather inspiration from there, brainstorm, sit down sketch out or layout what content I wanna do, and just go ahead, take the time and go for it. It’s all about having a plan, taking steps, and actions towards it.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>Do you have any advice for staying creative?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>Definitely take breaks. I find that when I take breaks I’m the most creative instead of burning out. Look at things around you not just on social media but in the real world. I get a lot of inspo for my illustrations from the nature around me, and our black community in general. I love Pinterest for getting inspo off of there but always take breaks because if you don’t, you will get creative blah I’ve had it before.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>Can you talk a bit about your journey with your natural hair and summarize some things you’ve learned since then?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>My journey with my natural hair wasn’t bad I can say that it was a learning process. When I started my journey I had relaxed hair, it was so damaged, smelled burnt, it was not cute but I went ahead and transition to be a natural for eight months, and I cut the hair off little by little.<br>\nOne thing that I’ve learned since becoming natural is that caring for natural hair is a second job. Natural hair needs a lot of attention and you need to have time and patience for it to be the healthiest it can be, ie properly cleansing, moisturizing, and handling your hair in general.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>What advice can you give for designing a routine with natural hair? Do you think natural, highly textured hair is inherently “high-maintenance”?</em></strong>   </p>\n<p>When creating a hair routine it is all based on your particular hair. Always try new techniques to see what your hair prefers especially if you are new to being natural. Once you find techniques and ways that work for you, you have to stay consistent with that routine because your hair will be expecting and used to that particular routine.<br>\nMy natural hair routine consists of washing and deep conditioning my hair every two weeks and then keeping my hair moisturized and re-moisturizing 2 times a week.<br>\nI don’t know for sure if having a tighter curl pattern is more maintenance compared to someone with type 3 or 2 hair but since I do have type 4 hair I can speak for myself and say it’s a second job.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>What do you consider the most important step when styling your hair?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>The most important step in my opinion when styling my hair is making sure I am moisturizing my hair properly. If you’re not moisturizing your hair properly and you do all that work it’s just like what’s the point moisture properly is key for natural hair.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>We all know it can be tricky to learn how to deal with our hair's texture. For you, what was the most difficult aspect of it?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>I will have to say the most difficult aspect of learning how to deal with my hair at the time was actually finding products that actually worked for my hair. I watched other Youtubers and influencers who had type 4 hair but their hair wasn’t technically like mine in a sense everybody's hair is different. They might recommend something for your hair and have the same hair texture ie type 4 but it might not work the same on your hair as it would have their hair so always experiment on your head of hair with products to see what your hair likes or not.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>What is the product/brand you recommend the most?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>I have tried so many different products and so many different brands but currently right now one of my favorites has to be Mielle Organics I recently just collaborate with them and tried their Honey &#x26; Pomegranate collection and I am in love with their styling portion of the collection, it is very moisturizing on my hair. I definitely recommend it.   </p>\n<p><strong><em>A piece of advice from Iyana:</em></strong>    </p>\n<p>A tip I can give someone that is starting their natural hair journey today is to experiment with products and technologies that work for you and get to know your hair. I was saying earlier people can recommend products to you all the time and they might work so great on their hair but once you get it on your hair it is a totally different story. Always experiment with products on your hair because everyone's hair is different. Experiment with different techniques.<br>\nI know there are so many ways to moisturize your hair like the LOC method or the LCO method. Also the aspects of how you would like to detangle your hair. You can finger detangle, you can use a wide-tooth comb, or a lot of people like using Denman brushes so there are so many things that go into knowing your hair. Take the time to get to know your hair and experiment with different products, different techniques, etc.  </p>","frontmatter":{"linkURL":"https://www.instagram.com/nicemarcela/","instaURL":"https://www.instagram.com/iyana_leshea/","title":"Iyana LeShea: Breaking the cycle of stigma and discrimination around black people with albinism.","type":"Hair Type: 4A/4B/4C","author":"@nicemarcela","instagrammer":"@iyana_leshea","date":"May 1st 2021","product1":{"title":"Cleansing","description":"I am usually not so picky about shampoos I know it just depends on what your hair is needing at the time, therefore sometimes I might go for clarifying cleansing shampoo, like Melanin Haircare Black Soap Shampoo, to get all the product off my hair, and then sometimes I might go for a moisturizing shampoo, like Creme Of Nature Pure Honey Shampoo, just cause I know my hair is not in need of a deep clean.","gallery":[{"image":{"publicURL":"/static/366dec9831cca8ef1a9f503ad046d9f0/MelaninHaircareshampoo.jpg"},"productURL":"https://melaninhaircare.com/products/reviving-african-black-soap-shampoo"},{"image":{"publicURL":"/static/3ca79f8d1904b27e0d322d4f9a4a4d30/cremeofnaturehoneyshampoo.png"},"productURL":"https://www.target.com/p/cr-232-me-of-nature-moisturizing-dry-defense-shampoo-12-fl-oz/-/A-75564853"}]},"product2":{"title":"Conditioning","description":"Now conditioner on the other hand I am very picky with, I love conditioner with tons of slip to it so one of my favorite conditioner is Aussie moist conditioner.
