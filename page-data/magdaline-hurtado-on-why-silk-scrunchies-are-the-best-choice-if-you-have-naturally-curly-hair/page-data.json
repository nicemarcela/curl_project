She comes from working in the music industry to landing in the haircare industry by creating <a href=\"https://helloupdo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hello Updo</a>, a new haircare brand that's making scrunchies more texture inclusive by adapting their size, elastic, and fabric to every curly/wavy/kinky/coily girl out there.   </p>\n<p>\"After transitioning back to my natural hair, it became impossible to find quality scrunchies that fit and protected my big coily pattern - a problem so many women face every day. For me, scrunchies shouldn't be one size fits all, so I went ahead and designed them in various sizes using handpicked elastic and 100% silk fibers creating the best fit and care for every texture.\"   </p>\n<p>You may have already heard about the buzz about silk pillowcases, but what about silk scrunchies for your hair? When compared to a regular cotton hair tie, a silk hair scrunchy prevents your hair from getting damaged over time. Unlike traditional hair ties, silk scrunchies prevent friction and tension due to the naturally smooth material. They are gentle on curls and can help promote hydrated, healthy, strong hair.  </p>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-img-attributes\" style=\"display:inline-block; width: 100%;margin:  0 auto;border-radius: 50px;\"><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 650px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/50c350a10dfb94a0069cb16bcd8bee86/47311/helloupdo.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"helloupdo\"\n        title=\"helloupdo\"\n        src=\"/static/50c350a10dfb94a0069cb16bcd8bee86/6aca1/helloupdo.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/50c350a10dfb94a0069cb16bcd8bee86/d2f63/helloupdo.jpg 163w,\n/static/50c350a10dfb94a0069cb16bcd8bee86/c989d/helloupdo.jpg 325w,\n/static/50c350a10dfb94a0069cb16bcd8bee86/6aca1/helloupdo.jpg 650w,\n/static/50c350a10dfb94a0069cb16bcd8bee86/7c09c/helloupdo.jpg 975w,\n/static/50c350a10dfb94a0069cb16bcd8bee86/47311/helloupdo.jpg 1080w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      / >\n  </a>\n    </span></span>  </p>\n<p><em>Keep scrolling to know more about Magdaline and Hello Updo</em> ‚¨áÔ∏è  </p>\n<p><strong><em>Tell us about your background and where you are now?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>After graduating college with my bachelor's degree in Public Relations, I went straight into working in international marketing in the music industry. I spent over a year at one of the largest record labels in the world then decided to return to school and pursue my MBA. I came up with the idea for Hello Updo the same week I got accepted into my top business school. It was a very uncertain but exciting time! It felt like everything was falling into place.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>Can you talk a bit about your journey with your natural hair and summarize some things you‚Äôve learned since then?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>I was 11 years old when I was given my first relaxer. After 4 years of relaxing my hair every 8-10 weeks, I vowed to never do it again. My last relaxer was in March of 2011 for my Quince√±era. The amount of damage each session caused to my hair and confidence began to outweigh the \"need\" for straight hair. I don‚Äôt remember what exactly motivated me to go back to natural. All I remember is that my mind was set and it has been the best decision I‚Äôve ever made.  </p>\n<p>It took about 4 years of trial and error to understand how to take care of my coily hair. I used to believe that a few days of no heat and curly hair products would make my hair curl. Looking back, that thought process came from desperation. I needed to practice patience not only for my hair but for myself. Today, I understand that only time and growth will make my hair curl.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>I‚Äôm amazed by Hello Updo, from concept to packaging! Can you tell us the story behind your motivation to start it?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>I started Hello Updo after growing tired of using hair ties that were not made for my hair type. After fully transitioning back to my natural hair in 2018, it became impossible to find quality scrunchies that fit and protected my big coily pattern - a problem so many people with long textured hair face daily.  </p>\n<p>The idea happened in the summer of 2019 when I was in Dominican Republic. It was very hot out and I want to put my hair up but, my hair ties kept snapping on me. I asked my boyfriend to stretch some new ones out for me and that‚Äôs when I questioned ‚Äúwhy doesn‚Äôt the industry offer quality scrunchies for my hair type?‚Äù  </p>\n<p>With this in mind, I went ahead and designed 100% silk scrunchies in two sizes, using handpicked elastic and fabric to create the best fit and care for every texture. A few weeks after I came up with the idea, I found myself at my grandma‚Äôs kitchen table learning how to cut and sew. That day I made my prototypes! I never turned back.  </p>\n<p>Since I created the product first, I had to build a brand around it. With that in mind, I focused on the message and values I wanted to convey through Hello Updo. I solidified that our purpose was to create space and represent textured hair with silk scrunchies while staying as eco-friendly as possible through our sustainable packaging. At Hello Updo we aim to offer quality hair care tools while lessening the human imprint on our planet.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>I think that Hello Updo contributes a lot to representation and inclusivity in the beauty industry. Can you share some thoughts on ‚Äúrepresentation‚Äù?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>Representation is soooo important to me! Growing up in a society that tells us what we need to look like is toxic. I never felt beautiful and found myself constantly trying to change my appearance to fit in. The easiest characteristic I could change was my hair.   </p>\n<p>I believe that if there would have been proper representation of girls and women who look like me in the media, and products by leading brands, I would have embraced my natural self-earlier in life. Through Hello Updo‚Äôs products, partnerships, and campaigns, I will make sure we are creating space and celebrating textured hair.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>How do you control the quality of Hello Updo‚Äôs elastics and silk fibers?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>Our scrunchies are currently made in-house by my mom and me. Because of this, I get to handpick the elastic and silk we use every time. Before launching we tried various elastics and silk weights to ensure the best quality in our products.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>What are the next steps in Hello Updo‚Äôs roadmap?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>We‚Äôre working on new products and developing cool partnerships. I‚Äôm excited for what‚Äôs in store for Hello Updo this year and the next! Stay tuned!  </p>\n<p><strong><em>How do you feel about inclusivity within the beauty/curly industry?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>I‚Äôm happy we are finally seeing diverse faces, skin tones, and hair textures in movies, shows, magazines, and advertisements. We have also seen an array of hair care products for diverse textures land on major shelves. However, there‚Äôs still so much work that has to be done.  </p>\n<p>I‚Äôm excited to see more Black and Brown-owned businesses come up, take space, and make big money. We deserve the spotlight and need to be included on the shelves of big-box stores! We know our community best so we should be the ones representing and serving them.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>What are some brands that you think are just killing it, with being inclusive?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>Right now I‚Äôm loving Girlfriend Collective, Rosen Skincare, and People Of Color!  </p>\n<p><strong><em>What do you consider the most important step when styling your hair?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>Moisturizing is the most IMPORTANT - point blank period.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>We all know it can be tricky to learn how to deal with our hair's texture. For you, what was the most difficult aspect of it?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>While transitioning back to natural, learning to be patient with my hair and understanding it really has a mind of its own was the most difficult concept to grasp. We get desperate for our curls and coils to look a specific way at all times but that perception of beauty (the one engraved into us) isn't reality.</p>\n<p>Once I learned that everyone's curls look, act, and are taken care of differently, I was able to understand which products are best for me. Just because there are products that are marketed for \"curly hair\" doesn't mean it will work for your hair. A lot of trial and error goes into understanding your hair.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>What is the brand you recommend the most?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>Hello Updo ü•∞. Not being biased but a lot of our hair's health has to do with the tools we use for it. Hello Updo texture inclusive silk scrunchies weren't designed for fashion but for protection and comfort.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>If someone starting their curly journey today, asked you for advice, what would you say?</em></strong>   </p>\n<p>It takes time - be patient. </p>\n<p>Products don't make your hair curl - healthy hair makes your hair curl. Your hair will need to grow out for you to see real natural results. </p>\n<p>Do not apply heat to your hair! You take 50 steps back every time you apply heat - it's not worth it. Blown out \"length checks\" are not worth it. If you want to check the length, take note of it in the shower. </p>\n<p>It'll all be worth it! I promise! </p>\n<p><em>Keep reading to know how Magdaline styles her beautiful coils, her fave products &#x26; techniques</em> ‚¨áÔ∏è</p>","frontmatter":{"linkURL":"https://www.instagram.com/nicemarcela/","instaURL":"https://www.instagram.com/magdalinehurtado/","title":"Magdaline Hurtado on why silk scrunchies are the best choice if you have naturally curly hair.","type":"Hair Type: 4A","author":"@nicemarcela","instagrammer":"@magdalinehurtado","date":"May 22nd 2021","product1":{"title":"Cleansing","description":"I love the Afro Love shampoo - it is made with mint, eucalyptus, and rosemary! The shampoo was made to deep cleanse textured hair and that is exactly what it does. I have tried so many shampoos and I feel like it is very hard to one that completely cleans your hair. After using this one, I am never going back. Other than parting my hair in two sections (horizontally from right to left) to make sure I wash every inch of my scalp thoroughly, I do not do any special techniques for a regular cleanse. If my hair is very knotty, I will start with a conditioner to detangle then use the cleanse. This makes it easier on my hair and arms lol.","gallery":[{"image":{"publicURL":"/static/8fa9ee725eb06787ef8bc16f751a93be/afroloveshampoo.jpg"},"productURL":"https://www.amazon.com/Afro-Love-Shampoo-16-oz/dp/B076VXDQR2"}]},"product2":{"title":"Conditioning","description":"I live by SheaMoisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Masque! I use it as a conditioner. It is honestly the only product that completely hydrates and moisturizes my hair, making it easy to detangle. \nTo condition, I break my hair up in about 4 or 6 sections (depends how tangled it is). I distribute the masque evenly throughout and make sure to give my ends a little extra loving because they split easily. \nDepending on the day, I finger comb or use a Denman brush starting from my ends to my scalp.","gallery":[{"image":{"publicURL":"/static/6597e910afaf58a1b8ad8e0f1a7c92d8/sheamoisturejamaicanmask.jpg"},"productURL":"https://www.sheamoisture.com/jamaican-black-castor-oil-strengthen-and-restore-treatment-masque/764302215554.html"},{"image":{"publicURL":"/static/792eb2b1036f3921d95070c063ce293f/denmanbrush.jpg"},"productURL":"https://denmanbrushus.com/products/d3-original-styler-7-row?variant=31964917334100"}]},"product3":{"title":"Styling","description":"I am so happy to have started to embrace my frizz!
