On <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sunflowervalentine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">her instagram</a> you'll find cute, sustainable outfits, clean beauty, and hair care. </p>\n<p>Thank You, Plantbased God is a space where Valentina and her partner, Kameron, gently share their plant based experience while educating, engaging and holding space for newcomers and learners to understand the value of incorporating the right nutrition into their lifestyle.</p>\n<p>In our talk, we discussed how her project started, inclusivity in the beauty industry, everything about her pretty, natural hair, and more. Keep reading our talk. </p>\n<p><strong><em>In a few words, how would you describe yourself?</em></strong></p>\n<p>I am a very determine, fun and outgoing person. I am very stern about my morals and ethics but am open minded. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Can you talk a bit about your journey with your natural hair and summarize some things you’ve learned since then?</em></strong></p>\n<p>I started my hair journey about 4 years ago after a very long life of dying, straightening and damaging my hair. I went through so many products trying to find what worked best for my curls. Each curly hair on my head is so unique and different — I went through about 15 products trying to find out what made them happy! I did not go through a big chop phase, and instead began to trim off what just was damaged, old, split ends and dead hair. Now after 4 years my entire head of hair is virgin!  </p>\n<p><strong><em>How did 'Thank you, Plantbased God' start? What was the motivation?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>I started it after embarking on my journey to live a more well rounded, holistic lifestyle. The inspiration came from my partner who has been vegan for 20+ years. He is my support system and co-founder at Thank you, Plantbased God!</p>\n<p><strong><em>As a creator - Where would you say your inspiration comes from?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>For my childhood, culture and everyday life.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>Do you have any favorite brands that you work with?</em></strong></p>\n<p>Not particularly! I am super open minded, but I do like working with brands that keep sustainability, eco friendly and nature at top of mind.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>How do you feel about inclusivity within the beauty industry?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>I could write a whole book about how I feel about inclusivity w/in the beauty industry. I will say I am glad it is finally happening.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>What are some brands that you think that are just killing it, with being inclusive?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>Briogeo, Cocokind Skincare and Gilfriend outwear.</p>\n<p><strong><em>What do you consider the most important step when styling your hair?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>Air drying </p>\n<p><strong><em>What is the product / brand you recommend the most? Why?</em></strong> </p>\n<p>Briogeo coil custard. It is so hydrating and makes your hair look beautiful. </p>\n<p><strong><em>A piece of advice from Valentina:</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>\"Drink lots of water, stay hydrated for yourself and your curls, and know it takes a lot of patience and trial and error.\" </p>","frontmatter":{"linkURL":"https://www.instagram.com/sunflowervalentine/","title":"Meet Valentina Padilla, lifestyle Influencer and creator of Thank You, Plantbased God.","type":"Hair Type: 3A/3B/3C","author":"@sunflowervalentine","date":"Feb 20th 2021","product1":{"title":"Cleansing","description":"I use Briogeo scalp cleanser or ACV shampoo for any product build up, and Oribe masks before wash day.","gallery":[{"image":{"publicURL":"/static/4dfd369c0b30f09932ba174b07d4ef7d/briogeoshampoo.png"},"productURL":"https://briogeohair.com/products/scalp-revival-charcoal-coconut-oil-micro-exfoliating-shampoo"},{"image":{"publicURL":"/static/b1e04c982d917b52c8f286d522996adf/oribemask.jpg"},"productURL":"https://www.oribe.com/oribestorefront/oribe/en/Collections/Signature/Signature-Moisture-Masque/p/400298"},{"image":{"publicURL":"/static/79debea87c70350b991f7e678c7a8e73/ouaishampoo.jpg"},"productURL":"https://theouai.com/products/detox-shampoo"}]},"product2":{"title":"Conditioning","description":"I use Ouai conditioner after using their ACV shampoo, I then mask w/ the Oribe mask for about 2 hours and rinse out.","gallery":[{"image":{"publicURL":"/static/6edd0152135f875c9d5550623f886255/ouaiconditioner.jpg"},"productURL":"https://theouai.com/products/medium-hair-conditioner"},{"image":{"publicURL":"/static/b1e04c982d917b52c8f286d522996adf/oribemask.jpg"},"productURL":"https://www.oribe.com/oribestorefront/oribe/en/Collections/Signature/Signature-Moisture-Masque/p/400298"}]},"product3":{"title":"Styling","description":"I section my hair and go in w/ either Briogeo coil custard or Oribe styling gel while misting my hair and raking the product through w/ my hand.","gallery":[{"image":{"publicURL":"/static/647ea9f64e38cbd42ab57e7fbb8f7239/briogeocustard.png"},"productURL":"https://briogeohair.com/products/curl-charisma-chia-flax-seed-coil-custard"},{"image":{"publicURL":"/static/a0e03aff0ec0dee83e0f4fc1907d2a34/oribegel.jpg"},"productURL":"https://www.oribe.com/oribestorefront/oribe/en/Collections/Signature/Gel-S%C3%A9rum-Radiance%2C-Magic-and-Hold/p/400018"}]},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/8e1b5322d13bfcdd22345a268d7e374c/ee604/valentina.png","srcSet":"/static/8e1b5322d13bfcdd22345a268d7e374c/69585/valentina.png 200w,\n/static/8e1b5322d13bfcdd22345a268d7e374c/497c6/valentina.png 400w,\n/static/8e1b5322d13bfcdd22345a268d7e374c/ee604/valentina.png 800w,\n/static/8e1b5322d13bfcdd22345a268d7e374c/05d05/valentina.png 1080w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"meet-valentina-padilla-lifestyle-influencer-and-creator-of-thank-you-plantbased-god"}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454","979176408"]}
