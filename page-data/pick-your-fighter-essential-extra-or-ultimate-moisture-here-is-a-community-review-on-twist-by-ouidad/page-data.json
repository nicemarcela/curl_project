You might be wondering if Twist and Ouidad are the same brands; No, they are two different brands but are part of the same family. TWIST has a pure moisture approach, as they claim \"They’re redefining the curl conversation by putting moisture first because moisture-balanced hair is what your curls need to thrive\". Their product lines have a moisture scale that you can mix and match to find your perfect blend, allowing you to customize a routine that works for your unique and personal curl journey. You can find yours through this <a href=\"https://twisthair.com/pages/hair-quiz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hair Quiz</a>.  </p>\n<p>I got the chance to try the products<sup id=\"fnref-1\"><a href=\"#fn-1\" class=\"footnote-ref\">1</a></sup> from their three scales: <em>Essential Moisture</em>, <em>Extra Moisture</em>, and <em>Ultimate Moisture</em>. To make this post as straightforward as possible I will just review my favorites! In this post, you will also find the community's opinion<sup id=\"fnref-2\"><a href=\"#fn-2\" class=\"footnote-ref\">2</a></sup> (of course 🥰), and the overall rating of the brand.

They invested in weightless formulas to keep your hair moisturized, and frizz-free but not weighed down. That's why in this line they've included a clarifying shampoo, and primer + gel as styling step. The Essential Moisture line includes ingredients such as:</p>\n<p>🌱 Aloe Vera: Soothes the scalp keeping it hydrated and preventing irritation.<br>\n🌱 Rice Protein: Encourages volume and texture so curls don't fall flat.<br>\n🌱 Panthenol: Protects hair's cuticle to add volume, shine, and texture.<br>\n🌱 Wheat Protein: Helps to strengthen strands from within, helping to make them healthier, shinier, and more manageable.<br>\n🌱 Sericin: Helps to improve texture, strength, and shine.<br>\n🌱 Coconut Oil: Moisturizes and protects against frizz and split ends.<br>\n🌱 Argan Oil: Helps improve hair's elasticity, making it less prone to breakage.  </p>\n<p><strong>ESSENTIAL MOISTURE <em>CLAIMS</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>The <em>Essential Moisture</em> line claims weightless moisture that keeps curls hydrated, combining multi-tasking weightless formulas. This line includes:   </p>\n<p>Curl Gel \"WEATHER UP GEL - THE NO-CRUNCH STYLER\"  </p>\n<p>Curls are more affected by humidity due to their unique structure, making them susceptible to frizz. Finally, a high-performance gel that's formulated specifically to fight off every curl's worst nightmare! It creates defined curls and blocks out humidity-inducing frizz and flyaways—all without leaving curls feeling sticky or crunchy.  </p>\n<p>Clarifying shampoo \"HIT RESET - BUILD-UP MINIMALIST\"  </p>\n<p>When your curls get weighed down by product build-up, grime, and excess oils, it's time for a reset. This gentle clarifying shampoo is all about balance. Eliminate build-up without stripping curls of the natural oils they need to form and stay strong. In just one wash, it will help reboot the curl pattern for a fresh start.</p>\n<p>Conditioner \"WEATHER OR NOT - THE ELEMENT DEFIER\"  </p>\n<p>Humidity is no threat to moisturized curls. This game-changing formula encourages curl definition and creates the perfect frizz-free foundation. By infusing nourishing moisture within strands and sealing the cuticle, frizz and humidity don't stand a chance.  </p>\n<p>Curl Primer \"RALLY THE CURLS - THE DYNAMITE DEFINER\"  </p>\n<p>This multitasking formula sets your curls up for success, working hard so you don't have to. The weightless primer boosts strength, enhances definition, increases elasticity, and reduces frizz. Help define and shape day-one curls or use them as an overnight treatment to restore your natural texture. Whatever your curls need, this powerful primer has got them covered.  </p>\n<p>Refreshing Spray \"HYPE IT UP - THE SAVVY CURL FORMER\"  </p>\n<p>When curls begin to droop on day-two or three (or four, or five...no judgment) this supercharged refreshing spray perks them right up. Chock full of botanicals and good-for-your-curls ingredients, the no-residue formula restores moisture, definition, and uniformity.  </p>\n<p><strong>ESSENTIAL MOISTURE <em>REVIEW</em></strong>   </p>\n<p>From this line my favorites are HIT RESET - Clarifying Shampoo and the WEATHER UP - Defining Gel.</p>\n<p>The clarifying shampoo Hit Reset is gentle and weightless so curls that get weighed down by heavier formulas can stay healthy and hydrated. I simply love this clarifying shampoo, it is the best clarifying shampoo I've ever tested. My hair feels deeply clean after using it, but at the same time, it doesn't give that <em>awful</em> stripping sensation of over-cleaned hair that I hate. I found it amazing how it can deeply clean and be as soft at the same time, even my straight-haired boyfriend is obsessed with it (even tho I insist he stops wasting it with his \"low-demand\" hair 😅). The ease of application and smell is also very good. No downsides. I must say I'm VERY impressed with this shampoo, it's worth every penny!</p>\n<p>The Weather up gel is very easy to apply, it has a geleé consistency that is not sticky at all, as some gels I've already tried before. Although, I'm not a \"gel type of girl\" I liked the result it gave to my hair, leaving it bouncy, and keeping the definition for a longer time! </p>\n<p>Available at <a href=\"https://twisthair.com/collections/essential-moisture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">twisthair.com</a> (9.99$/each) with FREE STANDARD SHIPPING on every order.<br>\n</br>  </p>\n<h5><strong>EXTRA MOISTURE - Lightweight moisture that replenishes parched curls</strong></h5>\n</br>\n<p>The <em>Extra Moisture</em> is an ultra-nourishing line that gives your curls the TLC they deserve to restore shine and improve your natural curl pattern.

I've had a hard time trying to find one that had the perfect balance for my 3a, dry curls UNTIL I found the oil-infused shampoo ON-REPEAT.\nThis shampoo has the PERFECT balance between moisture and cleaning for my hair, I almost feel I could even detangle my hair after using it because it feels so soft and hydrated, it also gives a <em>freshness</em> feeling to it that I love.

Overall, I think Twist has the perfect balance for shampoos! </p>\n<p>After falling in love with the ON-REPEAT shampoo, I tested the 4-in-1 GIMME IT ALL as a conditioner, and starting with its dense texture that gives rich hydration to the curls, it makes it easy to detangle and it makes the wash a more pleasing experience!\n</br>\n</br>  </p>\n<p>Available at <a href=\"https://twisthair.com/collections/extra-moisture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">twisthair.com</a> (9.99$/each) with FREE STANDARD SHIPPING on every order.  </p>\n<h5><strong>ULTIMATE MOISTURE - Deep hydration to nourish and restore curls</strong></h5>\n</br>\n<p>With the <em>Ultimate Moisture</em> you'll experience improved manageability as it restores moisture to dry, damaged curls, it is deepy hydrating and hyper nourishing, made for the most parched of curls, thirsty for definition, elasticity, and nourishment.

I've tried it as a primer and as a styling cream, I prefer and use it mostly as a styling cream, I don't feel the need to layer it with gel or mousse to complement its power! Tho if you have thin hair, be careful because as it's VERY moisturizing it can weigh down your hair! Better to start with a bit and go applying more as you feel the need, a little goes a long way when talking about this product.\n</br>  </p>\n<p>Available at <a href=\"https://twisthair.com/collections/ultimate-moisture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">twisthair.com</a> (9.99$/each) with FREE STANDARD SHIPPING on every order.<br>\n</br></p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/CQJvO1Vos-t/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"13\" style=\" background:#FFF;
