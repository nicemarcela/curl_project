It breaks easily and doesn‚Äôt retain length as well as medium and thick hair strands. It has fewer cuticle layers than medium and thick hair, and though water and moisture are easily absorbed, it also quickly evaporates leaving this type of hair dry and brittle. Fine hair is high porosity and is easily weighed down by heavy products like hair creams and butters.  </p>\n<p>The ultimate goal in caring for fine curly hair is to moisturize and strengthen with protein-rich products and use light products that won‚Äôt weigh it down.  </p>\n<p>Sascha Jenelle is a model, she has type 4 hair and has been discovering her way to take care of fine curls. In our talk, she shared that it hasn't always been easy, her hair was a source of frustration, but seeing results is what motivates her to continue to stick to her natural hair care regimen.<br>\nFor her, consistency is the key!üóùÔ∏è   </p>\n<p>\"When I was younger, I didn‚Äôt relax my hair very often, but I straightened it every two weeks‚Äîor I would get it put in braids, not really for protection just to put it up and not have to deal with it. I didn't know how to care for it and sadly I didn‚Äôt appreciate it either.  </p>\n<p>In high school, I started using YouTube and other websites to find out how I could grow my hair, but it was a bit difficult to apply what I learned because I wasn‚Äôt working and didn‚Äôt have the money to spend on hair products.<br>\nDealing with my hair was always a source of frustration. My hair was completely heat damaged and it wasn‚Äôt until freshman year of college that I learned what my true hair texture was.   </p>\n<p>I wasn‚Äôt consistent with my hair care until about 2 years ago tbh. It was then that I decided to never bleach it or flat iron it again‚Äîor at least until I get it to the state I want it to be at. Now I think my hair is so pretty and I‚Äôm so happy with myself because I made healthy decisions, I can now see the consistency paying off.  </p>\n<p>What‚Äôs been most difficult is facing the fact that I cannot do a lot of styling techniques that I see others doing because my hair is so fine. I have cut out flat ironing completely because of the damage it does to my hair. I also know that slicked styles are bad for my hair and pull my edges out if I wear them too often.  </p>\n<p>I still have a while to go before I‚Äôd call my hair healthy because I‚Äôm still in the process of cutting out damage from bleach, but seeing results is what motivates me to continue to stick to my regimen.\"  </p>\n<p><em>What do you consider the most important step when styling your hair?</em></p>\n<p>\"Shea butter has been most important for my hair recently.

Caring for your natural hair is a form of self love and a way to unlearn internalized anti-blackness. If your hair is similar to mine, it‚Äôs going to take you hours and sometimes an entire weekend to care for it properly, so have some movies ready.\" üçø</p>","frontmatter":{"linkURL":"https://www.instagram.com/sascha.c/","title":"Sascha Jenelle: Overcoming frustration through learning to take care of her fine curls.","type":"Hair Type: 3C/4A","author":"@sascha.c","color":"background-color: #ffffff","date":"Jan 23rd 2021","product1":{"title":"Cleansing","description":"I shampoo my hair once a week with a sulfate free shampoo.
