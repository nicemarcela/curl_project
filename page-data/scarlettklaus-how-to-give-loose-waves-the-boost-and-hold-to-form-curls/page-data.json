According to her dealing with that can be very tricky:  </p>\n<p>\"This is very hard to deal with because waves need such different care compared to tighter curls.<br>\nTo be honest, I‚Äôm still struggling with this, but what changed the game for me was mousse. I always shied away from it because it didn‚Äôt seem natural but it gives my loose waves the boost and hold to form curls while still moisturizing my tighter clumps.  </p>\n<p>I used to think I had to use lots of products on my hair for it to be healthy and defined. But now I find that less is more! I didn‚Äôt know it until I stopped but creams and gels weighed down my hair, even though it‚Äôs thick. With my looser texture, it just needs a little product to ensure moisture and encourage the curl, that‚Äôs what the leave-in and mousse do.\" </p>\n<p>Scarlett cleanses and styles her hair with As I am Naturally Coconut Co-wash and leave-in. Co-washing is great for keeping your hair moisturized without stripping its natural oils. If you use a cleansing conditioner on your hair, you can wash it more frequently than you may when washing with shampoo, because co-washing is gentler than using harsh detergents. You should co-wash with a conditioning cleanser at least once or twice a week, depending on your texture and the amount of product you tend to style your hair with.<br>\nFor deep conditioning, she likes to do DIYs homemade recipes. You can find great recipes for naturally curly hair <a href=\"https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/diy-2/best-diy-recipes-for-naturally-curly-hair\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>\"As I Am is my favorite brand. It‚Äôs geared more towards tighter textures, but honestly, it works great for my looser curls. It's very moisturizing and always gives me good definition and smells bomb.\"   </p>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-img-attributes\" style=\"display:block; box-shadow: 2px 2px 6px 0px;width: 50%;margin:  0 auto;border-radius: 50px;\"><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 650px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/7b2af47a33d1b7f9588ae51f7bf0a9cc/acb04/scar.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 125.15337423312883%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"scar\"\n        title=\"scar\"\n        src=\"/static/7b2af47a33d1b7f9588ae51f7bf0a9cc/6aca1/scar.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/7b2af47a33d1b7f9588ae51f7bf0a9cc/d2f63/scar.jpg 163w,\n/static/7b2af47a33d1b7f9588ae51f7bf0a9cc/c989d/scar.jpg 325w,\n/static/7b2af47a33d1b7f9588ae51f7bf0a9cc/6aca1/scar.jpg 650w,\n/static/7b2af47a33d1b7f9588ae51f7bf0a9cc/acb04/scar.jpg 750w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      / >\n  </a>\n    </span></span></p>\n<h5>If someone starting their curly journey today asked you for advice, what would you say?</h5>\n<p>\"I'd tell them their hair will change. I started with damaged barely 2b hair and now I have curls all over my head. Patience is key, it takes time to transition. Once I did a big chop I was able to start over, so I always recommend a chop or new haircut. Layers are great for looser patterns.\"</p>\n<p>That said, don't freak out you all. Time is key. Trust your process and don't be afraid of a good haircut. üíáüí™‚úÇÔ∏è</p>","frontmatter":{"linkURL":"https://www.instagram.com/scarlett.klaus/","title":"@scarlett.klaus: how to give loose waves the boost and hold to form curls","type":"Hair Type: 2C/3A","author":"@scarlett.klaus","color":"background-color: ffffff","date":"Sep 13th 2020","product1":{"title":"Cleansing: As I Am Naturally Coconut Co-wash","description":"\"It cleanses, moisturizes, and detangles my hair nicely.
