She describes herself as a curly girl by nature and a curl specialist by heart.<br>\nShe is the mind behind <a href=\"https://www.beyondtexture.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Beyond Texture</a>, a community and luxury curl boutique salon located in the heart of Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Beyond Texture's mission is to unify cultures by emphasizing texture education in the curly community.     </p>\n<p>What is it to embrace your texture for you? For me, it is loving my hair in these days which it is all matted (like today). I put it in a bun and try my best to ignore it, won't look at the mirror for too long because I will be reminded of the work I will have when detangling it on next washday. Even these days, I still take the time to spray some water, give it some moisture, and look at it with care and love.</p>\n<p>I think embracing your texture, as Jessica says, goes beyond. It goes beyond posting on Instagram your good hair days! It's mostly about all the love, attention, and patience you put on taking care of your hair. It is about going against all those people who said you'd look better with blow-fried hair. It's about your journey of acceptance, it's self-love.  </p>\n<p><em>Keep reading Jessica's inspiring story</em> ⬇️  </p>\n<p><strong><em>Tell us about your background?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>I was born in Wichita, Kansas as the oldest of three girls. My mother's side is a blend of european and mexican and my father's side is more european with an Irish emphasis. At least four or five generations were born in Kansas. Comparable to many stories I have heard from my guests, I was a frizzy haired girl who always struggled to find her way - with her curls and her hobbies. My mother always wore her curls, even did a curly perm for most of my upbringing, so I knew it was possible to #embraceyourcrown. But I just couldn't make sense of my curls. They were frizzy and unruly and oftentimes too thick to hide away in a ponytail. I couldn't even get my messy bun just right. It always bulked in all the wrong places and looked more \"messy\" than cute. I found myself \"hiding\" behind my hair. It's almost as though I didn't feel I was allowed to take up space.   </p>\n<p><strong><em>What's your opinion on why is that hard for people to accept their natural hair?</em></strong>    </p>\n<p>Curly hair has been looked down on and misunderstood from most cultures, trends, and the beauty industry itself. For decades, smooth hair meant polished, kempt, and wealthy. Curls were always described as the \"before\" photo showing off the unruly ways and difficult maintenance. It's simply that, misunderstood. Accepting your curls must start from within. It's more than just a physical journey, it's also an emotional journey. It's Beyond Texture. I think as the beauty industry begins to understand how to work with Texture, including how we speak about it, it will begin to further close the racial divide in hair.    </p>\n<p><strong><em>What do you recognize as the biggest need of our community?</em></strong>   </p>\n<p>I hope that we continue to encourage the voices of the professionals. I love that we have a community of women that want to help others better understand their texture. Let us not forget those who have dedicated their profession to texture. It's the \"psycurlogy\" of our industry to have the empathy to work with our textured guests.   </p>\n<p><strong><em>What helped you embracing YOUR texture?</em></strong>   </p>\n<p>I knew early on that when I straightened my hair I transformed into society's version of beauty. I felt striking. I received compliments and stood out in the crowd in a way I always dreamed of. But, I also couldn't help but feel a bit like an imposter; as though my beauty would be stripped when the frizz showed up again. And it always shows up.  </p>\n<p>If I couldn't feel seen in my curls, I began to feel as though I wasn't being seen as my authentic self. I began to wear my \"curls\" more. They were hardly curls though, after being subjected to heat damage, and product build-up, and they were mine. It wasn't until I discovered the Curly Girl Method through a pinterest pin in 2012 that helped me understand how to keep my curls healthy and in their full potential. Embracing My Crown allowed me to embrace myself.  </p>\n<p>Now, my curls always allow me to stand out in a crowd, and while still some won't understand their potential, I understand my own and that's priceless.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>Can you tell us the story of how 'Beyond Texture' started? What was your motivation?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>Beyond Texture first came to life in May 2015 when I came to NYC after I finished cosmetology school in Kansas. Determined to only do curly hair, I came to NYC to take two classes from the DevaCurl Academy. The plan was to head back to Kansas to practice my curl profession once I completed the two courses over a two week period. NYC had other plans. I never left New York City. In August I was offered a chair at the Soho DevaChan flagship salon. Here I was, trying to survive with not much familiarity by my side. Not to mention in a dog eat dog industry, neighborhood, and city.  </p>\n<p>I was forced to stretch far beyond my comfort zone, learning how to depend only on myself and discovering who that was. What started as my curly journey in 2012 led me to discovering my crown potential (and continuing to do so) and helping my guests discover theirs. This path has been far from easy, from unexpectedly losing my mother on my one year NYC anniversary to being too broke to go home. I had no choice but to survive. I had already made the leap to the big city, I couldn't turn away now. I'm here to remind you why it's Beyond Texture.  </p>\n<p>In February 2020, Beyond Texture became more than an Instagram handle, it became a small curl boutique salon in Brooklyn, NY. It was my #crazycurlydream brought to life. I had traveled the states with the Iconic brand, DevaCurl, teaching classes and enlightening the industry on what's to come in the world of curls, and it was time to create my own curly world. COVID hit shortly after I signed the lease, and I had to really remind myself of what I came to do for myself and many other curly girls out there. Once again, I couldn't throw in the towel now. So, I decided to use the time to really build the brand from the inside out and for you to discover the story behind the scenes. As it's always Beyond Texture.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>When did you actually realize you could help people embracing their natural hair?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>Shortly after discovering the \"curly girl method\" in 2012 and realizing the potential of my own curls, I knew other women and children had to know the secret to their texture. While I first just wanted to make a difference in Kansas where I was brought up, I was led to NYC to spread the curly word ;)  </p>\n<p><strong><em>What do you consider the most important step when styling your hair?</em></strong>   </p>\n<p>Styling while I'm still in the shower and using water as my main styler. I also think learning key ingredients to avoid is crucial.   </p>\n<p><strong><em>What is the brand you recommend the most? Why?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>Innersense Organic Beauty is a staple for me. It's super concentrated so I don't have to use much, the results are consistent, and I can customize my routine easily based on climate and any guest's texture.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>A piece of advice from Jess:</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>Condition with Intention! Your technique is 80% of your hair day and you can best learn the foundation of your technique through a professional!    </p>","frontmatter":{"linkURL":"https://www.instagram.com/nicemarcela/","instaURL":"https://www.instagram.com/beyond_texture/","title":"Talking Beyond Texture with curl specialist, Jessica Knight.","type":"Hair Type: 3A/3B","author":"@nicemarcela","instagrammer":"@beyond_texture","date":"Mar 27th 2021","product1":{"title":"Cleansing","description":"I alternate between AG Hair Balance and Innersense Hairbath 2-3x a week.
