I am multi-ethnic. My mother is Lebanese and Puerto Rican, my biological father is Black American. I’m born and raised in the Bay Area. My life and work center around art, community, and healing. I’m a professional poet and I also work with children and Black, Brown, and indigenous communities. My mission in life is to aid those who are oppressed to find new avenues for existing that aren’t rooted in inherent trauma and suffering, in hopes that we can create a better world.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>On your Insta, you give this impression that you’re a very expressive, outgoing person, what’s the role your hair plays on your personality?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>My hair is one of my superpowers. It has been at times the perfect touch to an outfit, other times it’s been my symbol for growth and healing. I like to switch up my look often, with wigs, braids, and cuts. I actually have been a “baldy” for about 6 years and am now in the process of growing my hair all the way back out for good. For the 6 years that I was cutting my hair off, a huge reason for that was how I coped with feeling stuck. My hair was what made me feel the change. It felt good to know that it would grow back and it also made me feel powerful to be able to watch that process happen. Seeing my curls form with patience and how they made me feel was really liberating. I was born a bald baby, so the growth process helped me to connect with my inner child as I learned myself through it.   </p>\n<p><strong><em>When you got bald, was there a special motivation? Can you talk in detail about that?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>Yes. I wanted to have short hair for a very long time, but there was such an emphasis on the importance of my hair and that I shouldn’t ruin it by cutting it off. I was discouraged from doing so for years, by both friends and my former partner. At the time, there weren’t very many young Bald women around me, so nobody could even really picture what I would look like enough to support that idea.   </p>\n<p>I knew that there was a relationship with my hair that wasn’t making sense all the way. It was such a symbol of vanity for me at the time and I also didn’t like how it aided the perpetuation of colorism because I fit the mold of “light-skinned mixed girl with curly “good” hair”. I thought there was a superficiality to it all and I didn’t like how it tokenized me and left no room for people to ever get to know me for my character. So I started wearing hijab, a traditional practice of head covering for religious reasons. While doing so, I was still shamed for covering my “good hair” and encouraged to just let it show because it’s so “beautiful”.  </p>\n<p>Overall, I didn’t like how everyone else felt like they had a say so in what I did with something that is apart of and grows from/for ME.<br>\nI was going through a really tough time in my relationship and I suffered heartbreak. I felt like I had no control over my life because heartbreak can sometimes come as a shock and make you have to grieve something you weren’t ready for. I was essentially having a lot of trouble letting go. So I woke up one day and adopted the belief that If I could let go of something as sacred to me as my hair, I could let go of anything. <em>My hair will grow again, and so will I.</em>   </p>\n<p><strong><em>What about growing back your hair?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>Whew, what a humbling experience. Since my hair had already become a symbol of letting go, I feel that sometimes I abused that method of shedding. I would cut or dye my hair as frequently as every 2 weeks because I was feeling so incredibly stuck. I feel incapable of growing past my experiences but at least I could depend on the change that came from my hair, along with the outside validation that accompanied my switch-ups. Everyone around me thought I was so powerful and would ask me questions about myself more often. I felt cared about and valued as I was bald. But it was not filling the space of me caring for and valuing myself.  </p>\n<p>The first time I grew my hair out for a year, was a bet against my mom just to prove that I could. So I did it to win the bet, but I didn’t pour any love or intention into my hair. I still would dye it or not tend to it and it was growing while I was going through another really difficult phase in my life. When the pandemic hit, I was about 15 months into growing my hair, unsure what I wanted to do with it and suffering a bit of stress hair loss.. and I ended up cutting it again.  </p>\n<p>August of 2020, I started a very precious healing journey and started practicing an African Traditional Religion in which I learned the importance of my hair. In this tradition, when you begin a very special year I ceremony, most times your head is shaved. I was fine with that because I had already been baldy for years. Until it came up in my specific healing process that I am no longer supposed to cut my hair because it is actually a trauma response for me personally. I also am a child of a deity that uses her hair as her superpower/weapon.   </p>\n<p>Through the process of growing it out for good, I’m learning patience. I’m learning that that is one of the sweetest forms of love that I can offer myself. Patience with my hair on the days that I don’t like how it looks and feel like not the most conventionally attractive person. Patience with myself as I go through the awkward phases of change and realizing that this is also healing. My hair is not only something to let go of but something special and uniquely mine. Something that I can keep. It truly is my superpower too.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>Most curly women transition from straight to natural hair, we can say you’re also living a transitioning process right now, how this journey has been?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>It is so rewarding. I’m seeing more and more that my hair has personality. Every day is not the same for it. Some days it wants to be big and full, other days it wants to lay flatter, or then there are the days it doesn’t want to cooperate. I take those days as the day to wear a headscarf and I believe that maybe those days my hair just wants to “stay in bed”. So I offer it that rest.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>Do you have any advice for women hesitating on shaving their heads?</em></strong>   </p>\n<p>Confidence in anything you do for yourself goes a lot further than any outside validation. If you’re doing it for others, it will never feel fully good for you. Also, be graceful with yourself. Not every style you’re going to like, but embrace the trial and error of it all. It’s fun if you let it be.   </p>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-img-attributes\" style=\"display:inline-block; width: 100%;margin:  0 auto;border-radius: 50px;\"><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 650px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/8eba580d65b814d5d979967b02af8e35/302a4/tee.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"tee\"\n        title=\"tee\"\n        src=\"/static/8eba580d65b814d5d979967b02af8e35/a6d36/tee.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/8eba580d65b814d5d979967b02af8e35/222b7/tee.png 163w,\n/static/8eba580d65b814d5d979967b02af8e35/ff46a/tee.png 325w,\n/static/8eba580d65b814d5d979967b02af8e35/a6d36/tee.png 650w,\n/static/8eba580d65b814d5d979967b02af8e35/e548f/tee.png 975w,\n/static/8eba580d65b814d5d979967b02af8e35/302a4/tee.png 1080w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      / >\n  </a>\n    </span></span>  </p>\n<p><strong><em>I saw on your Insta that you’re constantly playing with hairstyles, how do you decide the next style? Is there somewhere you find inspo?</em></strong>   </p>\n<p>I am inspired by so much. I believe that I can always try something out and if it doesn’t work, I can try something else. I draw from different eras of beauty and fashion when it comes to my clothing, so &#x26; try to embody that with my hair as well. I believe hair really can make or break an outfit. I also love the transience that is Black women’s hair. How styles have evolved over time and how versatile it is. So when I try out new hairstyles, I do so in full confidence but also in homage to the brave women who valued their hair before me.   </p>\n<p><strong><em>What do you consider the most important step when styling your hair?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>The moisturization/ drying process is the most important part of the process because depending on what style I’m going for, whether that is a damp more defined curl look or a fluffy fro look, I have to decide what makes the most sense for how much product I put in my hair as well as what way I want to dry my hair.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>We all know it can be tricky to learn how to deal with our hair's texture. For you, what was the most difficult aspect of it?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>The most difficult to learn was how much product is too much product and which products work best for my hair texture. Some products would weigh my hair down whereas others would make my hair have more body.   </p>\n<p><strong><em>What is the product/brand you recommend the most?</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>I love Shea moisture products and before the re-formula scandal, I loved Devacurl products.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>A piece of advice from Tee:</em></strong>    </p>\n<p>The root is as important as the ends. A healthy scalp will grow healthy hair. don’t overload and congest your scalp. the more ingredients that are hard to pronounce, the worst it is for your hair.     </p>","frontmatter":{"linkURL":"https://www.instagram.com/nicemarcela/","instaURL":"https://www.instagram.com/agrowinggirl333/","title":"Tyanna Braswell — Growing natural hair after shaving for 6 years: \"My hair will grow again, and so will I.\"","type":"Hair Type: 3A/3B/3C","author":"@nicemarcela","instagrammer":"@agrowinggirl333","date":"Apr 10th 2021","product1":{"title":"Cleansing","description":"Dr. Bronners Lavender Castile Soap.
