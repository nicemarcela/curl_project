Does it need any special care?</em></strong>   </p>\n<p>The only thing that has changed with my hair routine since I’ve colored it is leaving my hair mask on for an hour just to give my hair extra moisture. Other than that everything is pretty much still the same.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>What do you consider the most important step when styling your hair?</em></strong> </p>\n<p>Masking! Since I've dyed my hair it's super important for me to keep my hair hydrated and moisturized! </p>\n<p><strong><em>Can you talk a bit about your journey with your natural hair and summarize some things you’ve learned since then?</em></strong>    </p>\n<p>My journey started back in 2015 and what a journey it has been. I learned that it's okay to cut your hair, it’ll grow back. I’m on my third big chop and I couldn’t be more happier, short hair fits me so well. I also learned how to be patient with my hair, some parts need extra care than others, and that my curl patterns are different and not all the same which is totally fine.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>We all know it can be tricky to learn how to deal with our hair's texture. For you, what was the most difficult aspect of it? Why?</em></strong>   </p>\n<p>The tricky part for me was building patience when it came to hair during my transitional phase. Understanding the different hair patterns, what products do/don't work. What techniques were better for my hair comparing to others. I had to be patient and really understand my hair.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>How did VeroBonita start? What was the motivation?</em></strong>    </p>\n<p>I started VEROBONITA in 2012 as creative outlet for shopping on a budget. I was a freshmen in college, with full-time classes over at FIT and a full-time job, balancing both was hard but shopping for clothes was even harder for me financially. Thrifting played a BIG role in my life and still does till this day. I wanted to show the world that I had style and I didn't need to break the bank for it. Over the years the blog evolved from budget friendly outfits to talking more about my mental health illness, sharing beauty tips, travel and lifestyle content. I have such a love for fashion and myself for how far I’ve come as a human being that I passionately put into VEROBONITA.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>As a creative - Where would you say your inspiration comes from?</em></strong>   </p>\n<p>My inspiration comes from a lot of things, the people I’m surrounded, the streets I walk in NYC, old photos of my mom &#x26; family, galleries, I love going to the museum and checking out art for Inspo. </p>\n<p><strong><em>How did BrooklynPetite start? What was the motivation?</em></strong>   </p>\n<p>I started BrooklynPetite out of understanding the frustration that comes with going thrifting as a petite curvy woman and not being able to find my size, specifically denim! I decided I wanted to create a shop, a thrift/vintage e-com shop that can help women who deal with the issues of not finding things their sizes that are cute, trendy and within their budget! When I first started my shop the only thing I knew I wanted to do was just make someone happy about finally finding a pair of whatever pieces of clothing it is that can finally fit them, and I hope to finally get the chance to do so.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>What is the product/brand you recommend the most? Why?</em></strong>   </p>\n<p>If you're interested in dying your hair, Olaplex for sure! I highly recommend the Don't Despair repair hair mask from Briogeo and the Back to Life hair mask from Emerge.  </p>\n<p><strong><em>A piece of advice from Vero:</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>\"Be patient with your hair, yes the transitional phase isn't the prettiest BUT if your keep on going and taking the proper care of your hair the end results will be worth it!\" </p>","frontmatter":{"linkURL":"https://www.instagram.com/nicemarcela/","instaURL":"https://www.instagram.com/verooobonilla/","title":"Veronica Bonilla, the creator of VEROBONITA, on her relationship with style, and haircare for dyed hair.","type":"Hair Type: 3A/3B/3C","author":"@nicemarcela","instagrammer":"@verooobonilla","date":"Mar 6th 2021","product1":{"title":"Cleansing","description":"I like to pre-poo my hair with the Briogeo Scalp Revival before I shampoo my roots with a massage scalp tool for 5 mins to get all the product buildup out.
