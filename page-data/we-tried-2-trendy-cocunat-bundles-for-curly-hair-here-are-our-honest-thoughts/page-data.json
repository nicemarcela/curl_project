This pack includes capillary serum, curl booster, and curl spray for hydrated, flexible, and defined curls. The secret lies in 100% natural ingredients such as:</p>\n<p>üå± Coconut oil: Deeply moisturizes, nourishes, and prevents hair breakage. It's rich in lauric acid to repair damaged hair and split ends, reduces scalp sweating problems, strengthens hair, and helps eliminate dandruff.<br>\nüå± Argan oil: Deeply nourishes, minimizes the appearance of split ends, fights free radicals, deeply hydrates, provides elasticity.<br>\nüå± Porphyra umbilicalis extract (red algae): Strengthens hair.<br>\nüå± Hemp: Infused with powerful antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals to protect against UV radiation and free radicals.<br>\nüå± Sesame seed oil: Softens hair, combats frizz.<br>\nüå± Sodium polyitaconate: In charge of keeping the curls in place.<br>\n</br></p>\n<p><strong>CURLS IN THREE STEPS BUNDLE <em>CLAIMS</em>:</strong>  </p>\n<p>Flexible and loose curls.  </p>\n<p>NO matted effect.  </p>\n<p>Eliminates the frizz effect.    </p>\n<p><strong>CURLS IN THREE STEPS BUNDLE <em>REVIEW</em></strong>   </p>\n<p>The Curl Booster is a light/medium hold leave-in that has a jelly, very slippery texture, that makes the experience of applying it very easy and pleasant! Its texture is almost like a flax seeds gel but thinner and more manageable. It gives me very flexible curls, and every time I use this product I get the shiniest hair I've ever seen, there's not one single person that doesn't comment on how shiny my hair is.  </p>\n<p>My first impression of the Curl Spray was pretty good. I apply it after the curl booster and it locks really well the moisture and gives medium hold without making the hair crunchy or matted. There are two ways to use it, you can either spray it over your hair or on your hands and scrunch. I tried both, I prefer to apply on my hands and scrunch as it gives me more control of where I'm applying the product. </p>\n<p>There are two ways to use the Capillary Serum as well, you can either apply it before the leave-in or after. I always see the oil as the final step because it will seal your hair, so if you put it before the leave-in it will avoid the moisture the leave-in offers to come in, so the first option didn't really make sense to me. I use it as the final step of my styling when my hair is dry, I feel my hair drinks this oil in 2 seconds and it looks immediately nourished. LOVE IT!</p>\n<p>Overall, I completely ADORE this bundle! It really delivers all it claims and more. This bundle is my go-to and personal favorite!

It's described as ‚Äúan explosion of active ingredients working to treat dry, damaged, curly, or colored hair for an amazing set of locks‚Äù.  The formula includes 100% natural ingredients such as:  </p>\n<p>üå± Camellia: softens, hydrates, and eliminates frizz.<br>\nüå± Macadamia: provides intense shine and a silky smooth finish.<br>\nüå± Apricot: repairs damage caused by the sun, heat, and chemical treatments. ‚Å†<br>\nüå± Coconut Oil: prevents protein loss and strengthens the hair from root to tip.<br>\nüå± Pomegranate: an excellent source of antioxidants and protects against external damage.    </p>\n<p>This pack includes shampoo, conditioner, hair mask, and anti-frizz towel wrap for intense cleansing, moisturizing, and nourishment to restore your hair strand by strand. Available at <a href=\"https://cocunat.com/en-gr/product/rich-and-boombastic-hair-pack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cocunat.com</a> (78.16‚Ç¨) with code APRIL20.<br>\n</br></p>\n<p><strong>RICH &#x26; BOOMBASTIC BUNDLE <em>CLAIMS</em></strong></p>\n<p>The RICH Shampoo repairs, strengthens, smooths cuticles, and prevents frizz.  </p>\n<p>The RICH Conditioner instantly detangles, repairs split ends and stimulates hair growth.  </p>\n<p>The BOOMBASTIC Hairmask nourishes, repairs, and regenerates deep into the scalp.  </p>\n<p>Curly Girl Method tested.  </p>\n</br>\n<p><strong>RICH &#x26; BOOMBASTIC BUNDLE <em>REVIEW</em></strong>  </p>\n<p>My first impression of the shampoo was not bad, I find the texture very slippery which makes the ease of application good, and it smells really good (as all the products), but it's way too much lathering to me. They claim this is a sulfate-free shampoo that can be used as often as a low-poo, tho I use it and would just recommend it for clarifying as it cleans a lot! </p>\n<p>The repair conditioner is very creamy and moisturizing, the ease of application is pretty good as well. I usually let it sit for around 10 min meanwhile I wash my body/shave/scrub, this makes it much easier to detangle my hair. I have loved this conditioner since day one, and it has become one of my favorites. I definitely recommend it!</p>\n<p>The first time I tried the Boombastic mask it seemed that my hair went instantly from bad hair day to \"I just walked out of a hair salon\". It hydrated my hair, made it very soft and shiny, it also left my hair smelling amazing for the next few days. ü•∞\n</br>\n</br>  </p>\n<p><strong>COMMUNITY'S COMMENTS ON THEIR FAVORITES FROM BOTH BUNDLES:</strong>\n</br>  </p>\n<p>\"I immediately loved the boombastic mask, to be used with the turban towel.
