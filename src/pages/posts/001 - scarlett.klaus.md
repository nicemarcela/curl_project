We asked this beauty her hair care routine and she shared her hot tips for moisture + definition for loose waves.  
She has a variety of textures in her hair ranging from 2b waves to 3b spirals, according to her dealing with that can be very tricky:  

"This is very hard to deal with because waves need such different care compared to tighter curls. To be honest i‚Äôm still struggling with this, but what changed the game for me was mousse. I always shied away from it because it didn‚Äôt seem natural but it gives my loose waves the boost and hold to form curls while still moisturizing my tighter clumps.  

As I Am is my favorite brand. It‚Äôs geared more towards tighter textures, but honestly it works great for my looser curls. Its very moisturizing and always gives me good definition and smells bomb."   

If someone starting their curly journey today, asked you for advice, what would you say?   

"I'd tell them their hair will change. I started with damaged barely 2b hair and now I have curls all over my head. Patience is key, it takes time to transition. Once I did a big chop I was able to start over, so I always recommend a chop or new hair cut. Layers are great for looser patterns."

That said, don't freak out you all. Time is key. Trust your process and don't be afraid of a good haircut. üíáüí™‚úÇÔ∏è
