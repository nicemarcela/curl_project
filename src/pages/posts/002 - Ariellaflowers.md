For Ariella, detangling and retaining moisture are the most important when styling her hair. Most people don't pay too much attention to detangling, it's important to remember that it's a work of patience, if you don't have the time it might be better to invest in some up-do other than causing breakage to your curls.

She uses the LCO Method for styling: (leave in, cream, oil). To moisturise your hair, you would use a liquid-based product first, then a cream/butter and finish with an oil for effortless, lasting hydration and ultimately lead to longer hair growth. 
If you're a 4C type of curly you should DEFINETELY invest in this method.
She does it with *[Curls To Go leave-in conditioner by Jane Carter Solution](https://www.janecartersolution.com/products/un-tangle-me-weightless-leave-in-8-oz)*, then *[Extreme Wetline gel](https://www.amazon.in/Xtreme-Professional-Styling-35-26-Ounce/dp/B003DCJEJK)* or *[Phyto Gel Crème](https://www.phyto.fr/242963/gel-creme-sculpteur-de-boucles.html)* and *[CocoKind Watermelon Hemp oil](https://www.cocokind.com/products/watermelon-hemp-oil)*, and her own hair cbd spray that she makes.

Learning how to maximize styles and retain length are the most difficult for her: 

"It’s hard because our hair is like our minds, it changes all the time. As someone who transitioned from relaxers to natural while trimming my own hair it can be a lot to learn. It’s a labour of love!"

*[Curls to go leave-in](https://www.janecartersolution.com/products/un-tangle-me-weightless-leave-in-8-oz)* and *[Olaplex no.3 bonding Pre-treatment](https://olaplex.com/products/olaplex-no-3-hair-perfector)* are the products she recommends the most. The Olaplex no.3 is an at-home treatment, that reduces breakage and visibly strengthens hair, improving its look and feel. It promisses restore your hair's healthy appearance and texture by repairing damage and protecting hair structure.

A piece of advice from Ariella:

"LEAVE YOUR HAIR ALONE! Once it’s styled don’t touch it let it air dry leave it alone lol 
Also moisturize! Oil your scalp give it a massage."
