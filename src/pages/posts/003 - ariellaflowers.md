Ariella is a model and stylist, on [her Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ariellaflowers/), you can get a glimpse of her creative, brave soul. She shows part of it with her fun, pink coils! She shared with us a bit about how she takes care of her pretty hair.  

For Ariella, detangling and retaining moisture is the most important when styling her hair. 
Most people don't pay too much attention to detangling. It's important to remember that it's a work of patience, if you don't have the time it might be better to invest in some up-do styling other than causing breakage to your curls. Don't be afraid to go wild!  

She uses the LCO Method for styling: leave-in, cream, and oil. It consists of moisturizing your hair, with a liquid-based product first, then a cream/butter and finish with oil for effortless, lasting hydration and ultimately lead to longer hair growth. 
If you are a 4 type of curly you should DEFINITELY invest in this method. *[Curls To Go leave-in conditioner by Jane Carter Solution](https://www.janecartersolution.com/products/un-tangle-me-weightless-leave-in-8-oz)*, then *[Extreme Wetline gel](https://www.amazon.in/Xtreme-Professional-Styling-35-26-Ounce/dp/B003DCJEJK)* or *[Phyto Gel Crème](https://www.phyto.fr/242963/gel-creme-sculpteur-de-boucles.html)* and *[CocoKind Watermelon Hemp oil](https://www.cocokind.com/products/watermelon-hemp-oil)*, and her own hair CBD spray that she makes (yeah, I know... I'm also dying for the recipe!).  

Learning how to maximize styles and retain length is the most difficult for her:

"It’s hard because our hair is like our minds, it changes all the time. As someone who transitioned from relaxers to natural while trimming my hair, it can be a lot to learn. It’s a labor of love!"

*[Curls to go leave-in](https://www.janecartersolution.com/products/un-tangle-me-weightless-leave-in-8-oz)* and *[Olaplex no.3 bonding Pre-treatment](https://olaplex.com/products/olaplex-no-3-hair-perfector)* are the products she recommends the most. The Olaplex no.3 is an at-home treatment, that reduces breakage and visibly strengthens hair, improving its look and feel. It promises to restore your hair's healthy appearance and texture by repairing damage and protecting hair structure.

#####A piece of advice from Ariella:  


"LEAVE YOUR HAIR ALONE! Once it’s styled don’t touch it, let it air dry. Leave it alone, lol. Also moisturize, oil your scalp, give it a massage."
