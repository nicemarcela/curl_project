    title: 'Styling'
    description: 'I love styling my hair straight out of the shower (WET!) by raking and scrunching in the following order - leave-in conditioner and/or curl cream, gel, and mousse for extra volume. I let my hair air dry 1/3 of the way while shaking my head/continuously scrunching, then I blow dry with a diffuser. My current favorite styling products are from As I Am (Leave-in Conditioner),  Only Curls (Curl Cream), Briogeo (Rice Amino + Quinoa Frizz Control Gel), and REF Stockholm (Fiber Mousse).'

Being a Naturalista is much more than your hair or what you eat. It is about praising your characteristics magnificence, and the determination to live a healthy lifestyle. To make it real simple… it is a state of mind.  
This week's curl talk, with Cherie Glover, is all about how she includes naturalista lifestyle in her hair care.  

Cherie is a curly creator and marketing manager, for her being consistent with her curls is the hardest:
 
"Consistency in curls is the hardest - but I think that's something you live with when you are a naturalista.   
When I started to use the Curly Girl Method approved products[^1] I noticed a huge difference in how my hair reacted, so taking the time to understand your hair and its needs is a crucial step.  

Being a Naturalista made me dive into what it really means to give worth to and nurture my hair in its natural state – to gain a better understanding and appreciation for my curls, and how to keep them happy."  

*What advice would you give to someone that wants to become a naturalista?*  

"I think first and foremost, you have to see the beauty in your natural hair - just the way it is.   
For too long, I’ve heard (and unfortunately still hear) how curly hair is linked to negative descriptors such as “unprofessional, frizzy, messy, ugly, difficult”, and it’s disheartening how western beauty ideals have successfully made us with curly/kinky hair have to continuously go through this journey growing up.   
So my advice is to pause and to really try and appreciate the uniqueness that is your curls – it is the worth you attach to your natural hair that will help you through this journey."

*What do you consider the most important step when styling your hair?*  

"It all depends on what you want from your curls - I LOVE volume so for me styling for definition (hydration + volume) and then drying with a diffuser is a must. 
If I only could pick one brand I would recommend Only Curls for styling and Dizziak for Shampoo/Conditioner (The conditioner can also be used as a hair mask!). They work for most hair types and always give lovely results! Plus they smell amazing."


*A piece of advice from Cherie:*  

"Patience, patience, patience. But also, find your curly crew IRL or online to always have inspiration, motivation, and knowledge always close by. It's always more fun when you get to share your journey with someone!"
