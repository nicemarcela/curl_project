product3: 
    title: 'Styling: LCO Method'
    description: 'I love styling my hair straight out of the shower (WET!) by raking and scrunching in the following order - leave-in conditioner and/or curl cream, gel, and mousse for extra volume. I let my hair air dry 1/3 of the way while shaking my head/continuously scrunching, then I blow dry with a diffuser. My current favorite styling products are from As I Am (Leave-in Conditioner),  Only Curls (Curl Cream), Briogeo (Rice Amino + Quinoa Frizz Control Gel), and REF Stockholm (Fiber Mousse).'

What do you consider the most important step when styling your hair? *
It all depends on what you want from your curls - I LOVE volume so for me styling for definition (hydration + volume) and then blow drying with a diffuser is a must.
We all know it can be tricky to learn how to deal with our hair's texture. For you, what was / is the most difficult aspect of it? Why?
Consistency in curls is the hardest - but I think that's something you live with when you are a naturalista. When I started to use CG approved products I noticed a huge difference in how my hair reacted, so taking the time to understand your hair and its needs is a crucial step. 
What is the product / brand you recommend the most? Why? *
If I only could pick one brand I would recommend Dizziak for Shampoo/Conditioner (The conditioner can also be used as a hair mask!) and Only Curls for styling. They work for most hair types and always give lovely results! Plus they smell amazing. 
If someone starting their curly journey today, asked you for advice, what would you say? ( Could be products, tips for styling, a motivational sentence, or anything you find valid. )
Patience, patience, patience. But also, find your curly crew IRL or online to always have inspiration, motivation, and knowledge always close by. It's always more fun when you get to share your journey with someone! 
Is there anything you would add to this form that you think would be relevant for the community?
Inspirational accounts? I for one absolutely love my friend and curly girl inspiration @curlsfirst on Instagram.
