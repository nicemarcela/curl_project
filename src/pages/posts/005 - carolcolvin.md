product1: 
    title: 'As I Am Coconut Cowash'
    description: 'These days, I wash my hair with Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil Strengthen & Restore Shampoo. I used SM Coconut & Hibiscus system all through college and for most of post-grad until recently (so at least five years). But I have bleached and dyed hair, so I wanted something nourishing. I rinse my hair through, detangle it, and lather up with my shampoo.'

product2: 
    title: 'Curl dream'
    description: 'After rinsing my shampoo out, I follow up with SM Jamaican Black Castor Oil conditioner (replacing SM Coconut & Hibiscus conditioner). However, about a month ago, my hair was feeling "fried, dyed, and laid to the side," as my mom would say. So instead of reupping my SM conditioner, I bought Mielle Pomegranate & Honey Moisturizing & Detangling Conditioner.'

product3: 
    title: 'Creamy shampoo'
    description: 'After I rinse my hair for the final time, I dry my hair with a T-shirt headwrap until it is damp. I section out my hair, then use a fine tooth comb to detangle it before I slather on SM Coconut Hibiscus Styling Milk. Then I finger twist my hair, until my whole head (well, at least, the non-shaved part) is in twists. When I am ready to take the twists out, I dab my fingers with coconut oil and do so. '

What do you consider the most important step when styling your hair? *
Detangling post-shower is my most important step. Sure, I can twist my hair without detangling it, but the twists (and later, the curls) don't look nearly as good. Plus, since my hair is kinky 4c that's fine, my hair will get tangled and therefore, matted, very easily!
We all know it can be tricky to learn how to deal with our hair's texture. For you, what was / is the most difficult aspect of it? Why?
As a kid, tween, and teenager, I cycled through relaxed hair, braids for a hot sec, and relaxed and straightened hair — with little say in how I could wear my hair. When I went away to college, I went to PWI in a deeply segregated city and the BIPOC neighborhoods were inaccessible to me as a student. So for the most part, I had to figure out how to take care of my hair as a means of survival. Even though my regimen was born out of necessity, the end result was beautiful. I learned a lot about experimentation, self-reliance, and identity, especially as a Black non-binary person. I realized that I truly get to decide who I am. I exist on my own terms.
What is the product / brand you recommend the most? Why? *
I recommend Good Dye Young hair dye, and I'm not just recommending because the brand was founded by Hayley Williams, lead singer of Paramore. And I know so many Black millennials/Gen Zers love Paramore! It's because I used a fair variety of hair dyes, and none were as kind to my natural hair as Good Dye Young. It is so nourishing and the color really holds. I trusted GDY as soon as I looked through their Insta feed and saw the brand's repost of Black people who weren't influencers — just other natural-haired consumers who'd taken a chance. GDY is also cruelty-free, and smells like bergamot and citrus, which is such a welcome change from those other hair dyes that simply *stank.*
If someone starting their curly journey today, asked you for advice, what would you say? ( Could be products, tips for styling, a motivational sentence, or anything you find valid. )
Pay attention to your climate! My hair journey started in humid, coastal South Carolina and took place largely in central New York, where it snowed more than 75% of the school, was almost always freezing temperatures, and was windy as hell. I also studied abroad in England for one semester, where it was temperate and rainy. All of these climates had different impacts on my hair.
