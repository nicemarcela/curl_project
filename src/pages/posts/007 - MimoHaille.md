Mimo is a social impact enthusiast who has managed various efforts ranging from violence prevention in Oakland, HIV Research/Prevention in West/Central Africa, and homelessness prevention in Santa Clara County. She is the co-founder of Coco Coalition, a nonprofit that adresses emotional, mental, and holistic health for Black women. She is also the founder of Great Good Leaders, a platform that connects social impact leaders.   

Thought it was good enough for Mimo? Nope! Guessed wrong! She has lately launched Mimo's Coffee, an e-commerce that born out of a family-owned Ethiopian spice shop with her Mama. Yes, she does all of that and still finds time to take care of her pretty curls!  

Intrigued? Keep on reading our talk to discover her beautiful story of healing after being diagnosed with hypothyroidism and alopecia, and learn her Ethiopian tips for a buttery, moisturized crown of curls!

***Can you talk a bit about your journey with your natural hair and summarize some things youâ€™ve learned since then?***

I love this question! When I was younger, my mom and aunts used to say it was a day job to take care of my hair. I had long and very tight curls growing up, and they used to say it took a village to take care of it. In Ethiopia, we have a tradition of putting pure uncured butter on our hair for hours. It is used to enrich your hair with moisture and super hydration. It was the only way for my mother to manage my crown since fancy shampoo and conditioners weren't a thing back then.  

When I got to the Bay Area at the age of 13, adding butter to my hair routine seemed impossible. We were assimilating to a new culture, and things moved fast. That's when my mother decided to perm my hair, so it's easily manageable. I pretty much had my hair in a ponytail or braided after wash and conditioner for years to come. Wearing my hair natural was not something I experimented with until I got to college, and let me tell you, I felt so dang liberated! I let out my curls, although there were very few curl products out at that time.   

When I was 27, I got diagnosed with hypothyroidism and minor alopecia, which impacted my hair journey. I had to learn to pay close attention to what I put in my hair, eating habits, and internal healing. As the years progressed, I fell in love with taking care of my hair, almost as close as how we used to back in Ethiopia, and I am so happy with it. I need to get better at putting more moisture and doing deep oil or butter treatments now, but overall super happy with my journey.  

***How do you think your self-image impacts in matters of being a powerful woman?***

I am a firm believer that everything happens for a reason. I had (still have :)) gorgeous hair and it was one of my strongest assets. But when I was diagnosed, a lot about my confidence, understanding of self, mental health, and physical health, changed. Self-image is something I had to work towards; I had to unravel a lot of negative self-talk to be confident about what defines me. I let go of those unrealistic expectations that I put on myself, learning to love myself with flaws and all, and just being me with no fear of being judged.  

When I got diagnosed, I felt as though the universe told me that I had deprioritized myself so much that it finally caught up. I never knew how to heal from past trauma, that eating whatever will harm me, and that stress could manifest through my body. At that moment, I had to learn the biggest lesson: first loving myself with missing patches in my head and the transformation of healing that I needed to grasp.  

It was a journey for sure, but it was a great wake-up call that Mimo needed to put herself first! Then these organizations were born, I started allowing myself to stay curious and challenge myself to new and empowering journeys! Now, I have the strongest and most centered self-image of myself! *I see Mimo, and I see power.* That's some badass shit :) 

***Do you think your appearance, more specifically your hair, has represented any kind of difficulty in this path?***

Phew, yes! I mean from all the things I shared above to continuing this journey of getting older, loving yourself through and through all present and presented difficulty. However, the most powerful lesson has been to stay grounded in whatever journey you are in. If that means you want to experiment with your hair for self-expression, do it and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. If you want to chop it all off and start over, literally and fugitively, do it! Being centered and anchored in your decision to do whatever the hell you want to do is the key to finding joy in those difficult moments!!  


***What do you consider the most important step when styling your hair?***

Hm, great question! I think the conditioning of the hair is important. I want to make sure that it's not only looking good but making sure it's moisturized, healthy, and the curls are popping for a week! Also, love using my favorite oil combo by Zamla - a black-owned hair oil company. I use it right after I put my leave-in conditioner for an extra shine.

***We all know it can be tricky to learn how to deal with our hair's texture. For you, what was/is the most difficult aspect of it? Why?***

It sure is! I think the most difficult aspect has been dealing with unique textures as I am getting older. I am noticing that my white hair needs more love compared to the other parts of my hair. Building awareness of texture in just one head is a pretty interesting feat. 

***What is the product/brand you recommend the most? Why?*** 

I know our curl journeys can be different but I love using Carol's Daughter shampoo and conditioner a lot! I also love products that have a good slip and can support my hair for moisture. It looks like TGIN is winning for me now :)

***A piece of advice from Mimo:***  

"Phew, be patient! It's a journey, indeed. But don't worry, like most new things, practice, trial, and errors, and lots of deep breathes are part of the process. Love yourself through the learning journey, and it's ok to ask around to find a great product that works for you."
