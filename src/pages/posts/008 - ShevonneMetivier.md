product1: 
    title: 'Cleansing'
    description: 'Per wash day, I shampoo my hair 1-2 times depending on how dirty my hair feels. But in between washes I also wet my hair in the shower just as a slight refresh (only water). My wash days are usually 5-7 days apart. I tend to use shampoos from the Dove line. '

product2: 
    title: 'Conditioning'
    description: 'After shampooing, I coat my hair with enough conditioner to make the detangling process as easy as possible then leave in for about five minutes. I tend to use Dove conditioners that pair with the shampoo used. And recently, I have been deep conditioning my hair on days that I shampoo, using a heating cap, which gives me the best results. My current deep conditioner is Carols Daughter Sacred Tiare restoring hair mask.'

product3: 
    title: 'Styling'
    description: 'So currently I have two different pairs of products I interchange between but use the same technique. The technique consists of combing the base through my hair from top to bottom, then sectioning and adding the curl defining product, and finger combing through. I try not to apply products directly onto my roots/scalp so as to avoid product build-up there and also aid in giving my hair some extra volume.  So my drugstore pair is Texture My Way - Keep it Curly cream as the base and Garnier Surfer Hair Power Putty strength 2 as the definer or, on the pricier side, TreLuxe Untie the Knot Leave-in Conditioner as the base and TreLuxe Hi-Definition Curl enhancer styling gel. The latter pair gives a better hold but leaves a residue, unlike my drugstore pair.'

Certain women don't even have to speak to communicate with you. You feel their effervescent presence as soon as you enter their space. That was the first impression I got when I first found Shevonne Metivier on Instagram.  

Shevonne is a host, a passionate and creative with a strong desire to live a fulfilling and purposeful life, as she describes herself. In our talk she shared her favorite drugstore products, as she says: "You don't have to bust your pocket in order to have healthy hair!". Much agreed, Shev!   

Keep reading to discover her drugstore picks and learn a bit about her natural hair journey.


***Can you talk a bit about your journey with your natural hair and summarize some things you’ve learned since then?***  

Well, I didn’t always love my natural hair, and there was a period in my teenage years where my hair was kept chemically straightened or texturized. I was always fed the narrative from those around me that natural hair was untidy and unprofessional and something that needed to be ‘fixed’. But I realized that there was no need to ‘fix’ what was naturally growing out of my head but rather, I needed to understand it and learn how to take care of it. Society has been fed some truly warped beauty standards over the years, but thankfully we are experiencing a shift toward embracing natural hair and I am committed now more than ever to embrace every kink and curl in all their uniqueness!  

***Do you think your appearance, more specifically your hair, has represented any kind of difficulty in your career?***  

To be honest I have not been faced with any negative backlash about my appearance within the industry thus far. And I have worn my hair in various styles in front the camera; Natural, flat ironed and in braided styles. However, when it came to corporate positions that I’ve previously held, concern was expressed about the ‘puffiness’ or frizziness of my hair for the workplace, it was too distracting. It seems that my hair has a personality of its own, one which is too big for the workplace but is suitable for the entertainment industry. Go figure.  

***On your Insta, you give this impression that you’re a very expressive, outgoing person, what’s the role your hair plays on your personality?***  

I do not conform to norms easily, much like my hair which does what it wants on most days. No wash day is usually the same as the last haha. And that’s perfectly fine! I embrace my hair in all its uniqueness as I would any situation I’m faced with in my life. Whilst I know that I am more than my hair, I appreciate its versatility which helps amplifying my expressive and outspoken personality!  

***What do you consider the most important step when styling your hair?***

Having a good defining gel/custard to enhance longevity of my curls without much frizz.  

***What is the product/brand you recommend the most?***  

Carol's Daughter 'Sacred Tiare' restoring hair mask or anything from this brand in general, because their products are big on moisture.  

***A piece of advice from Shev:***  

"Love the hair that grows out of your head! Respect it and learn how to take care of your specific hair types. Hydration is key, so especially if you're like me who gives more attention to defining gels, get in that moisture some other way like through deep conditioning or fresh aloe masks; There are tons of DIY hair masks out there! Do your research, you don't have to bust your pocket in order to have healthy hair."
