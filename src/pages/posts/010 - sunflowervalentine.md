In our talk, we discussed how her project started, inclusivity in the beauty industry, everything about her pretty, natural hair, and more. Keep reading our talk. 


***In a few words, how would you describe yourself?***

I am a very determine, fun and outgoing person. I am very stern about my morals and ethics but am open minded. 

***Can you talk a bit about your journey with your natural hair and summarize some things you’ve learned since then?***

I started my hair journey about 4 years ago after a very long life of dying, straightening and damaging my hair. I went through so many products trying to find what worked best for my curls. Each curly hair on my head is so unique and different — I went through about 15 products trying to find out what made them happy! I did not go through a big chop phase, and instead began to trim off what just was damaged, old, split ends and dead hair. Now after 4 years my entire head of hair is virgin!  


***How did 'Thank you, Plantbased God' start? What was the motivation?***  

I started it after embarking on my journey to live a more well rounded, holistic lifestyle. The inspiration came from my partner who has been vegan for 20+ years. He is my support system and co-founder at Thank you, Plantbased God!

***As a creator - Where would you say your inspiration comes from?***  

For my childhood, culture and everyday life.  

***Do you have any favorite brands that you work with?***

Not particularly! I am super open minded, but I do like working with brands that keep sustainability, eco friendly and nature at top of mind.  

***How do you feel about inclusivity within the beauty industry?***  

I could write a whole book about how I feel about inclusivity w/in the beauty industry. I will say I am glad it is finally happening.  

***What are some brands that you think that are just killing it, with being inclusive?***  

Briogeo, Cocokind Skincare and Gilfriend outwear.

***What do you consider the most important step when styling your hair?***  

Air drying 

***What is the product / brand you recommend the most? Why?*** 

Briogeo coil custard. It is so hydrating and makes your hair look beautiful. 


***A piece of advice from Valentina:***  

"Drink lots of water, stay hydrated for yourself and your curls, and know it takes a lot of patience and trial and error."
