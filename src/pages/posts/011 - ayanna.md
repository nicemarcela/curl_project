    title: 'Cleansing'
    description: 'Detangle out of the shower and separate hair into 4 sections to make it easier to get to the scalp — I have super thick hair so this is very important. I will use the palm of my fingertips to scrub my scalp. I also have a scalp massager that I use occasionally. I am currently using the Creme of Nature mango + shea butter line but I am not really particular about my shampoo. I use a clarifying shampoo when I have a protective style in or if I have been heavy on the product. I also dont run away from Sulfates — sometimes you need them to get your scalp clean!'

    title: 'Conditioning'
    description: 'I apply my conditioner in the same sections and usually let it sit on my scalp while I shower. I am currently using the Creme of Nature Mango and Shea butter conditioner but I love the Aussie Miracle Moist for a deep condition. Depending on how I am feeling I will twist my hair in the shower or use my Denman brush to really brush the conditioner in but I usually just use my hands.'

    title: 'Styling'
    description: 'Now this really depends on what I have planned for the week. If I have somewhere to go the next day, I will usually apply a heat protectant, blowdry my hair, add my Creme of Nature Mango Shea Butter leave-in or whipped shea and mango butter from the beauty supply, and braid it in prep for a braidout the next day. If I am not in a rush, I will do the same thing but let it air dry. I usually use a little oil ( castor, olive, jojoba, and a lil peppermint ) on my scalp, ends, and edges for good measure.'

You just need a glance at Ayanna's Instagram to realize she is definitely not an average woman. She is from NY, and is a first-gen Jamaican American. She works in the fashion industry, and is the creator of two amazing projects: [Brainwash Media and Brainwash Club](https://brainwash.media/), which are digital media platform catered to gen-z and millennial voices to share their stories, and an online shop featuring vintage & local emerging brands with a special emphasis on black & brown designers (which I personally found a fantastic idea and am in love with). Ayanna is a "creative business, man", as she defines herself.  

In this talk, Ayanna shared how she styles her beautiful type 4 hair to feel powerful, she uses her hair to take up as much space as possible!

Some people have grown up hearing that type 4 hair is unmanageable, unattractive, or otherwise undesirable. These ideas are as far from the truth as it gets! Your hair is not only beautiful but incredibly versatile, capable of infinite styles and looks. It's easily managed and taken care of with the correct regimen and products.   

If you have type 4 hair like Ayanna's, here is your 101 guide to maintain, grow, and care for a healthy hair: [^1]

**RETAIN MOISTURE**  
Find a good moisturizer AND a good sealant. Oils like coconut oil and olive oil, and creams like Shea butter are effective at sealing moisture in your hair. If you wear a protective style, don’t forget to moisturize regularly!  
<br>

**SHAMPOO MINDFULLY**  
Yes, you still need to shampoo regularly to keep your scalp and hair clean- but you can lengthen the time between washes to 2, 3, or even 4 weeks. Avoid shampoos that contain sulfates or any of these other harmful ingredients, and opt for a mild, sulfate-free shampoo or a co-wash.  
<br>

**DETANGLE**  
This is extra important because the tight curl pattern of your hair can cause hairs to curl and coil around each other, causing tangles. Tangles lead to breakage, which hinders growth. Detangle regularly and gently, use conditioners to add slip and help with the process. When you find knots, don’t yank- use your fingers to gently pull hairs out of the knot.   
<br>

**DEEP CONDITION WEEKLY**  
This will keep your hair healthy, bouncy, and shiny, and will prevent snagging and tangles.   
<br>

**STYLE WITH SHRINKAGE IN MIND**  
Shrinkage can be frustrating because it keeps you from seeing growth, and it can also make your hair more susceptible to tangles and single strand knots. You can explore heat-free styles, such as twist outs, braid outs, and bantu knots. But don't forget to embrace and celebrate shrinkage, and have fun with it!  
<br>

Last and most important: **CELEBRATE YOUR HAIR WITH PRIDE!**

***Keep reading our talk*** ⬇️  


***Can you talk a bit about your journey with your natural hair and summarize some things you’ve learned since then?***  

I've only been natural for 5 years and I spent most of my life with relaxed hair so in a way learning how to style my natural hair brought me closer to myself. It allowed me to be comfortable in my own skin ( cheesy, but true ).  

***What's the role your hair plays in your personality?***  

I use my hair to take up as much space as possible. For me, I like to, what I call, power dressing. Wearing pieces and styling them in ways that make me feel powerful. My favorite hairstyles are either having my hair super big and curly or fully braided back in cornrows.   

***How did Brainwash Media and Brainwash Club start? What was your inspiration to start?***  

Brainwash began as an outlet for me to have thoughtful conversations and publish my writing online and slowly I started to tap my friends to come on board, contribute articles and now we're a mighty team of five. Brainwash Media truly is a digital media platform catered to gen-z and millennial voices to share their stories, their way. Brainwash Club was launched in July of 2020. I wanted to create a space for emerging young designers of color to sell their items without having to worry about all the logistics that come with selling products online. We currently house 5 brands from across the country and one international brand. It's still a little baby but we're excited to grow it into the next Opening Ceremony/  

***As a creative - is there anything that was tough for you to hear?***  

Truthfully,  the toughest criticisms I've ever heard have come from me. Overcoming the self-doubt that comes along with creating something from nothing is a daily battle.  

***What advice would you give young girls of color thinking about going into a creative field?***  

Find your people. Be in community with other girls of color and work laterally. And just start!  

***What do you consider the most important step when styling your hair?***  

DETANGLING. As a type 4 girl, I am not really one for wash and go's. Not because I don't like my curl pattern, but because it'll get tangled so quickly so I like to detangle really well during wash day and then keep it detangled as much as possible.  

***We all know it can be tricky to learn how to deal with our hair's texture. For you, what was the most difficult aspect of it?***  

I think for me it was learning how to care for type 4 hair in general. I've had a relaxer from 8-20 so transitioning from relaxed hair to type 4 was a huge adjustment but I love it now. There are so many resources ( Youtube, blogs, Twitter ) to look to for new styles and new products. I am so low maintenance now that I use as few products as possible.  

***What is the product/brand you recommend the most?***  

CREME OF NATURE! They are so affordable and can be found in most beauty supply stores and drugstores. I've never tried a product from their line that I didn't love.   

***A piece of advice from Ayanna:***  

"Less is more. Don't let these influencers convince you that you need all the new gadgets and products. Do what works for you and your hair."
