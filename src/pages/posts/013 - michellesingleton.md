    title: 'Cleansing'
    description: 'Cleansing always feels like a happy dance for my scalp. I am currently on my 2nd bottle of Pattern Beauty Hydrating Shampoo and so far I love it except for how slippery/watery it feels coming out of the bottle. I like to prep my hair with conditioner (especially if my curls have matted from friction from the collar of my clothes or sleep). I am currently using "As I am" Coconut co-wash to prep and get the hair moisturized. I lightly rinse then apply the shampoo and rinse.

    title: 'Conditioning'
    description: 'I apply Pattern Beauty Leave-in conditioner, I actually do not use a traditional conditioner. It is always a leave-in! Depending on what my hair feels like, I like to do two applications of a leave-in conditioner after the cleanse and use my hands to squeeze out the excess. This is preparation for my styling.'

    title: 'Styling'
    description: 'Step 1: Leave-in conditioner is a huge part of my styling process. I use Pattern Beauty best selling leave-in conditioner. I do not know why I waited so long to do the float test to figure out my hair porosity. I actually always knew I was really dry ie. skin & hair, so I assumed my hair just needed more assistance with moisture. My hair type might be viewed as high porosity but it is in fact low porosity - Low porosity hair repels moisture when you try to wet it and is hard to process since it resists penetration of chemicals. It is important for me to use a cream first and then apply an oil to help lock in moisture. Step 2: I apply Avocurl Daily Moisturizer after my leave-in, it is an AHHmazing product, made with aloe and avocado which my hair is a big fan of! Final step and Pro tip for long haired curlies: After styling and while your hair is still damp put it in a traditional bonnet, the bonnet holding the hair in and the drying process overnight will give you the same if not better bounce. This is perfect for me because my hair has lost all its layers and curlies need shape to highlight our crown and gorgeous faces! I also use a wide-tooth comb to detangle my curls. I also LOVE a good baby hair swirl or just let them live and do their own thing. I have been using Pattern Beauty "toothbrush" styling tool for a couple of months now and my baby hairs really appreciate the support.'

Michelle is a true force of nature, who speaks up for what she believes in, and follows through with action. She describes herself as a vibrant and dynamic creative woman, and I honestly couldn't agree more. She inspires and keeps you motivated, you feel her energy as soon as you enter her space, and you don't feel like leaving without getting to know her better. 

Michelle is without a clue a multifaceted woman, her background includes working in the fashion industry, she is the mind behind ["Her Place Is In"](https://www.herplaceisin.com/): an art collective cultivating social change, and she has also been studying plant medicine to provide holistic wellness for the BIPOC community. 

*Get to know about her journey of acceptance, the next steps for Her Place Is In, and her personal goals as a holistic medicine woman.* ⬇️   


***What do you consider the most important step when styling your hair?***  

Drying! If it's not done right, my curls will create their own style. The curls appreciate the help :)  

***We all know it can be tricky to learn how to care for our hair's texture. For you, what was the most difficult aspect of it?***  

Acceptance was the most difficult aspect for me. As a child, I didn't really think much about hair maintenance until my mom stopped styling my hair around age 9. I had to start doing it myself and I didn't know what to do so I threw it up in a bun and kept it moving.   

From time to time I would get my hair pressed in a kitchen with a hot comb by my auntie and it was during this time that I was unconsciously learning to reject my natural hair texture. Hot combs have been a part of my cultural experience as a Black and Latina woman, but I didn't realize I was already building a relationship with my hair and it wasn't a loving one.   

In 6th grade, I spent so much time using a medium-sized curling iron to flatten my curls (this was before flat-irons were popular). It was bad, I accidentally burned my baby sister being so obsessed with straightening my hair. By the time I got to high school, I was flat ironing my hair as often as I could. I just didn't feel pretty unless my hair was straight.   
By the 11th grade, I noticed severe heat damage and breakage that was only 2-3 inches away from my scalp. I knew that I needed to stop putting this pressure on myself because I was ruining my hair.   

In my senior year in high school, a very close friend who did hair, from braids to weaves and twists, etc. (she was basically a self-taught cosmetologist) said something that completely changed my relationship with my hair: "I want to see your hair curly!", she enthusiastically offered to do my hair. She gave me about 4 zig-zag corn-rows on one side of my head and put the rest of my hair in a high side pony-tail with my luscious curls bursting out like a bouquet. She made me feel pretty and showed me how dynamic my hair was. This brought me to hair acceptance.   

My hair ranges from 3A-3C and is looked at as "good hair" because it's "manageable" but I don't think people realize how much everyone without naturally straight experiences dislikes and shames towards their own hair. I've received comments from white and black folks about my natural hair whether it's someone telling me that I look better or more professional with a fresh flat-iron to comments that dismiss my hair's needs "all you need to do is throw some water on your hair."  

Everyone has to style and maintain their hair and it requires treatment and steps to care for our crown. My hair is vast, carries my truth, and ancestral wisdom! How I treat my crown is a reflection of our loving relationship.  


***How did 'Her Place Is In' start? What was the motivation?***   

There was a lot of connecting that happened prior to the formation of Her Place Is In. Without telling the whole story, a long-time friend of mine answered a Photographer's Craigslist ad in the Bay Area, CA and we later formed the collective that you know as Her Place Is In.  

We all came together (both old and new friends) to celebrate women and diversity with a bold and colorful photoshoot. During the creative process, we recognized how often we were faced with a variety of injustices from racism in the workplace, immigration rights, and society's limiting beliefs about who are, then after hours of brainstorming, the name Her Place Is In came up. This name was born out of the idea that we were reclaiming our place in the world and intentionally living outside of the box that society gave us. I.e. Her Place Is In___Wherever she chooses.   

We are a diverse collective of women, and the more we bonded the easier it was to naturally dive deeper into more meaningful dialogue about social issues regarding diversity, empowerment, community, and change. Our art and our reflections developed alongside one another to become something bigger than we originally imagined.

***As a creative - Where would you say your inspiration comes from? And how do you put yourself in that moment, to create?***  

For as long as I can remember I have always had a huge imagination. It didn't take much for me to be inspired and I created as I went. I am a self-taught illustrator and picked up a pencil around ~7, played the violin in elementary, participated in choir, and loved the arts!  

As I have grown into myself I have gravitated towards community and nature a lot. I am about 98% extrovert according to the Myer-Briggs personality test and insightful conversations truly spark my brain’s creative flow. I get inspired by people's lived experiences and even my own.  

Since the pandemic, I don't get to be in the community as often as I like but when I really am stuck and need to find that moment, I will turn to the outdoors or venture into the world. Whether that be finding a new coffee shop and noticing the small details such as companies’ branding to the new arrivals at Target ;)  

***What is something that you love working on?***  

I am working on 2 new exciting things! Her Place Is In will be launching a podcast this spring and I am studying Herbalism. I will be moving into my 2nd year of studying plant medicine, obtained my Reiki certitification, and just finished yoga teacher training. I have been engaged and connected to holistic wellness since 2015 but 2020 propelled my wellness journey!   

Soon, I will be starting my own brand as a holistic medicine woman, offer healing and ancestral guidance for the BIPOC community. I've been exhausted watching communities suffer from both intergenerational trauma and their unfortunate lived experiences. My goal is to serve the community by creating access to these healing modalities for well-being.  

***What advice would you give young girls of color thinking about going into a creative field?***   

Trust yourself and move with intention! I spent so much time second-guessing my abilities in my career that it only kept me from fulfilling the things I wanted to do most. Also, create your own table and invite other people. It will be your responsibility to speak up, pave the way and reach back to lift others up.  

***What is something that you’ve made peace with?***  

Trying to make everyone happy. There's an expectation that comes with being a Black and Latina woman, by making everyone feel comfortable, safe, and nurtured however it's me(us) that needs the nurturing.  

***A piece of advice from Michelle:***    

"Embrace your dynamic crown! I want people to be in relationship with their hair, really get to know what it likes, doesn't like, how it likes to be treated and tended to, notice how it denies or accepts hair products, notice the foods it wants more of, etc. We often take so much time getting to know our plants, our partners, and everything else but our hair is also deserving of more understanding. Be aware of what your hair is trying to tell you!"
