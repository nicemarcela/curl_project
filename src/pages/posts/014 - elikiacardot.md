Elikia is an interior designer and property stylist based in Sydney. She grew up and spent most of her childhood in Gabon, Africa then moved to France for a year before going to Sidney.

She is a role model for “keeping it simple” when the subject is her hair and beauty! She shares how being raised and surrounded by busy African women had a huge influence on her minimalist way of seeing life, and in her hair care, there's nothing pure shea butter can't fix!  

***How long have you been natural? Can you go into detail about your natural hair journey?***  
 
I've always been natural. I grew up in Africa so most kids had their hair in braids. I rarely straightened my hair until I turned 13 when I relaxed my hair for the first time. It only lasted a year and I decided to cut my hair and embrace the curls again! It definitely felt weird going natural again. I never knew my hair was curly since it was always in braids or brushed out so it took some getting used to, but ultimately I loved it and never went back!   
 
***What advice can you give for designing a simple routine with natural hair? Do you think natural, highly textured hair is inherently “high-maintenance”?***  

Everyone's hair is different, but I found that the best way to get to know your hair is to start with a simple routine. Growing up in Gabon surrounded by black women you learn that moisturizing is a must. So for me, I used any shampoo with a conditioner and then used pure shea butter in my hair and that's all I needed. 

I stuck to this until I was 15 then realized my hair texture had changed so I looked for more sophisticated products but always kept it to the big three: shampoo, conditioner, and oil/butter.
I honestly don't know why textured hair scares some people. It's extremely easy to take care of and style, as long as you give it some love and moisture it’ll thank you!  
 
***Do you have any particular goals for your hair, such as a length goal?***  

My only hair goal would be to keep it healthy. I am always thinking of how I should style my hair, and right now I'm obsessed with shorter hair! But lucky for me, my hair grows quite fast so if I ever want long hair I wouldn't have to wait too long!  

***What inspired your general quest for minimalism in your hair routine?***  

Part of it is laziness -the quicker it is the better- and the other is that I grew up and was raised by women who didn't spend money on unnecessary products or spend a whole day conditioning their hair. There was no such thing as wash day. So everything needed to be quick and convenient for the busy African woman. And somehow they all had amazing hair!  
 
***Do you have any other tips or suggestions concerning “keeping it simple” with natural hair and overall beauty routines?***  
 
The key to keeping it simple is accepting what you’ve got. I think a lot of the time we unnecessarily complicate things to cover up what's already there. I personally just let my hair do its thing and do not worry too much about it. I take the same approach to beauty: I keep it as simple as possible and it all comes down to moisturizers. So a tip would be to find a good moisturizer and stick to it, it will always bring everything together!   

***What do you consider the most important step when styling your hair?***  

The drying part is super important! The way you dry your hair is what determines how defined or bug your curls will be!  

***We all know it can be tricky to learn how to deal with our hair's texture. For you, what is the most difficult aspect of it? Why?***  

I don't think I’ve ever struggled with my hair texture. I think my hair is easier to manage than most. Water and coconut oil were the only products I used and I would go with any shampoo and conditioner and still have great results. But I must say that finding the right products for your hair Is definitely a journey.  

***What is the brand you recommend the most?***  

Shea moisture is definitely my go-to, but I think you should always have some pure shea butter for the days your hair is extra dry.  


***A piece of advice from Elikia:***  

Keep it simple! You don't need 100 products on your head. Take time to get to know your hair and try one product at a time.
