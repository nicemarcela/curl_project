product1: 
    title: 'Cleansing'
    description: 'I do a full wash twice a week. Depending on the products I have used to style my hair I will either use the As I am Co-wash or a shampoo (this differs but I have a few favs: Lush Curly Wurly (discontinued) / Giovanni 50/50 balance shampoo). I do like using sulfates because I have seen this is beneficial for my hair and scalp. 
    I start on my scalp using a scalp brush and lather it up. Using the foam on my ends. I just know people are going to hate me for the Lush shampoo, but the shampoo allows me to detangle in my cleansing step. Which I love, cause I hate that dry shampoo feeling. If my hair is particularly dirty I condition first to loosen dirt or shampoo twice. This tends to happen after I wear buns or styles using a lot of gel/hairspray.'

product2: 
    title: 'Conditioning'
    description: 'In a full wash (shampoo) I like using a deep conditioner as my conditioning step. My favorite will always be the Shea Moisture Raw Shea & Cupuaçu, which is discontinued I think, so I moved on to the Yari Cosmetics Green Curls Deep conditioning mask & Shea Moisture Strength + Color Care Masque. Since I have bleached blonde hair. 
    If I am not doing a full wash, but only a conditioner to either cleanse or prep my hair for styling I like using the Yari Green Curls Hydrating Conditioner. I use a detangling brush and let it sit while I do my shower routine. Rinse out according to instructions.'

product3: 
    title: 'Styling'
    description: 'I have heavy hair due to thickness and length so after rinsing my hair, I will add a leave-in conditioner, my favorites are the Aphogee Curlific Leave-in spray and the Giovanni lightweight leave-in conditioner. I use them both depending if I want more volume or definition. 
    If I want volume I would go for less cream and more gel. My go-to cream is the Cantu Curl activator, but I am currently looking for one that is a little more lightweight. I will use that on top of my leave-in while it is still dripping wet and scrunch both products in. 
    I use the CurlyGirlMovement hair towel on the silky side to soak up some water so it does not dilute the products too much, brush it through and then add gel. The ones I like using for volume are the Yari Green Curls Curlmaker and the Curlessence curling jelly. When I want volume I will use the Denman Brush in horizontal sections moving up.
    If I want definition I would go for more cream and a stronger gel, I use a large amount of the Yari Green gurls curl maker and a little of the Cream of Nature Argan Hair Snot gel. 
    For definition, I use the Denman brush in vertical sections moving parallel from the section away from the head. After this, I will scrunch with the CurlyGirlmovement towel before blowdrying. 
    Drying will depend on the time I have tbh. For volume, I start hover-drying with my head down, for definition with head upright. Both ways I finish with drying to make it fluffy and add jojoba oil or olive oil as a finishing step when I scrunch out the cast.'

Liyah Park is a model and influencer, her content is about women, society, sex, mental health, and LGBTQIA+ rights. She was part of the cast of a relationship reality show in the Netherlands called Temptation Island. Since its end, she has focused more on her mental health and personal projects, such as her podcast Vrouwentoilet ("Women's bathroom" in English), Op HUID! ("on skin!" in English), and partnerships like [Zapatos (streetwear/sneakers)](https://www.instagram.com/wearezapatos/).

In our talk, Liyah also shared how she takes care of her pretty bleached waves, her relationship with her body, mental health during lockdown, and dealing with social media. *Keep scrolling to discover* ⬇️  

***In a few words, how do you define yourself?***  

I think I would define myself as: crazy, confident, ambitious, and passionate. I think my ambition really kept me from losing myself. Also very much anti-patriarchy.   

***Tell us about your background and where you are now?***  

I think is hard to answer but I've always struggled with anxiety and depression. Now after the reality tv aftermath has melted away I feel like I can be my complete self again. My content has always been about women, society, sex, mental health, and LGBTQIA+ (or LGBTQ) rights. 
I've grown from conforming to the rules of our patriarchal society to going against it completely. Right now, I'm in a space where I'm proud of myself and the way I manage my mental health. 
I'm bringing all the insights I've gathered over the years to my podcast: Vrouwentoilet (en: Women's bathroom). This is where I invite guests to talk about women-related topics in an open conversation. This happens side by side with other projects I'm currently a part of, like Zapatos (streetwear/sneakers), and also coming this year is Op HUID! (lit: on skin!) where we deep dive into the waters between societal issues and hip-hop. Vrouwentoilet is my baby, it's very close to my heart. These are all dutch shows, but I'm hoping to do one for international audiences soon.   

***Can you talk a bit about your journey with your natural hair and summarize some things you’ve learned since then?***  

I think one of the biggest lessons was protein and moisture balance, which is really hard to figure out. It took me a full year to really get the hang of it and I still feel like it's not always right. The second thing is that the Curly girl method doesn't always work for me. There's a way to have great hair and not adhere to all the rules. I don't believe in rules as a whole when it comes to hair/skincare.   

***Do you have any special tricks for taking care of your bleached waves?***  

For me, it's small steps. My hairdresser is a blessing as she's really good with my hair. I bleached using small steps and lots of bond builders during the process. It takes about 3/4 weeks for my hair to get back to its curly state after bleaching so during that time I make sure to pamper it with moisture. I try to not shampoo and only co-wash for a long time.   

***You seem to be very comfortable with your body on social media, was it something you had to make peace with or you’ve always been okay with it?***  

I've been insecure about my looks for the longest time, but I just noticed how the most beautiful people are insecure as well. Everyone has insecurities, so why bother feeling so upset about it? Why let it keep me from being my best self and enjoying the fruits of life? 
The beauty standards we have in this world change, so rarely we will fit the mold of beauty. Next to that we are taught to be insecure and change our appearance to conform to eurocentric looks and for others to capitalize on those insecurities. 
I will not fill another person's pocket with my money by finding myself ugly, no ma'am. I firmly believe that when you don't find yourself attractive you're just not your own type. Which really makes sense to me.   

***Have you ever had to check someone on an ignorant comment? How do you respond to these comments?***  

This question made me laugh. I am not a fan of "being the bigger person"; if you approach me disrespectfully, I will respond in the same manner. Being the bigger person really just means "put up with it" to me. And I don't get why I should most of the time? You wouldn't put up with it when someone would walk up to you and speak to you like that? But it's not worth engaging too much as that is all they really want: *access to you*. 
I delete most hateful comments. I know people are intimidated by sex-positive content so it's not worth the energy. My socials are my platform and I do not owe anyone a space on it. My Instagram, Twitter, and even clubhouse are dictatorships. If you can't respect it, you need to go.
People get to hide behind private profiles while I'm living my life publicly. I won't change what I'm doing anyway, so I don't need other people's opinions and critiques. I'm very unapologetic on social media when it comes to being myself. 

***How do you deal with your mental health at the “corona” times we are living in now? How do you stay motivated?***  

It's been so hard, I've been working the entire lockdown. There have been weeks where I was just barely holding on. Nevertheless, there's one rule I have. I am allowed to feel bad; this is legit the most comforting thing I've taught myself during the lockdown. 
Whenever it gets really hard I allow myself 1 full day (sometimes 2 as I want to binge Grey's anatomy) to feel horrible. I cry for hours, I don't shower, clean, reach for my phone or socialize. 24 hours to be a mess and then I pick it up again. Every setback is a reason to work harder. Two steps forward, one step back.  

***On your Insta, you give this impression that you’re a very confident, outgoing person, what’s the role your hair plays on your personality?***  

I've always played with my hair color, I think changing my hair is a key to changing my look. I don't do much with make-up as I have 3/4 looks I kind of go back to. The big change is always the hair. Cutting bangs, a new color, shorter, longer, fluffier, in a bun or a ponytail. I've had cherry red hair, orange, highlights, bright pink, grey, black and light brown. It's like I have these alter egos. Different color = different Liyah, but not really haha. 

***What’s the best advice you’ve ever received from a woman?***  

Never let men tell you what to do or who you are. Especially if they are not paying, or paid, by you. Maybe this will sound super feminist, but men tend to paternalize me, especially due to my social media content. 
I think a softer version of the best advice from a woman would be: never compromise on your freedom, you only live for yourself. 


***We all know it can be tricky to learn how to deal with our hair's texture. For you, what is the most difficult aspect of it?***  

I can't have holy grail products, because my hair needs change depending on the weather, water hardness (traveling sucks due to this), if it has been bleached, and stress levels. 
The most difficult aspect is finding out what your hair needs. Listening to your hair and being patient is hard. I deal with my bad hair days and don't care that much about how it looks. I don't need perfect curls all the time.   

***What is the product/brand you recommend the most?***  

I think the product that really made a difference in my routine is the Cantu Curl activator. Even though I am looking for a lightweight replacement. This product really increased the definition of my hair making it more curly and less wavy.  

***A piece of advice from Liyah:***  

CGM is not the only way to have great hair, to be honest CGM didn't work for me for a long time. I switch back and forth, but most of my products are CGM safe. I like ManesbyMell on Youtube, she explains this really well. 

Bleached hair is like having a cat, she will behave most of the time, but really has her own way of doing things. I know it takes up to 3 weeks for my hair to recover from a session at the hairdresser. Also, you don't need a curly hairdresser, you need a hairdresser that knows curly hair. 
My best cuts were from non-curly specialized hairdressers, being specialized does not guarantee the results you would like. 

Also, just be okay with the days your hair doesn't do what you want.   

***Is there anything you would add that you think would be relevant for the community?***  

I think haircare is similar to skincare. It's not only about the ingredients but also how they work together. Be less obsessed with the ingredients and more with the results they can provide. I tend to hate coconut in most products, but I like it in my Lush shampoo. 
Also, I keep track of products I liked, hated, and want to try on a Pinterest page. This keeps me from buying products that are similar to what I hated and keeps me from trying too many products at the same time. (I always finish my products, so I don't have more than 2 for each step).
