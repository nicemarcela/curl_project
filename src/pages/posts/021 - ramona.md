    title: 'Cleansing'
    description: 'I cleanse my hair about 3 times every washday with Curly Secret Hello Fresh Hair Shampoo because, at the first time, all the greasiness, dirt, and oils are coming off the scalp. By the third time, I am sure that my scalp is clean enough. I use a scalp massaging brush to stimulate the blood flow and to loosen up any dirt. Then I rinse it out with warm water. Once a month I clarify with Curly Secret Deep Clean Shampoo.'

    title: 'Conditioning'
    description: 'I never actually use conditioner, I immediately deep condition my hair with the Shea Moisture Deep conditioner (fruit fusion) after shampooing because, in my opinion, conditioners do not do much other than detangling the hair and weight down my hair. I do not apply the deep conditioner to my roots as this will leave me with greasy hair within 3 days. I mix my deep conditioners with one teaspoon of olaplex N¬∞3 and then leave it on for 20 minutes. I rinse it out with either cold or warm water. It depends on my mood.'

    title: 'Styling'
    description: 'I use one to two styling products and I use it on soaking wet hair. I brush my hair upside down and brush my hair away from the scalp with my Denman brush. Then I rake the Curly Secret Reviving Leave-in in and scrunch, scrunch, scrunch! Then I take a microfiber towel and scrunch the excess water out. After that, I apply the Curly Secret Hemp & Flaxseeds gel or Curly Secret Volumizing Foam by scrunching it in my hair. Sometimes I glaze a mousse in and then scrunch. After that, I diffuse it on low speed/medium heat.'

Ramona is a veterinary assistant from the Netherlands, and a digital creator on Instagram, where she shares her routine and 2C/3A curls haircare. She has recently gone vegan and decided to implement cruelty-free and vegan products in her curly haircare as well. 

*"But how do I know if they're cruelty-free products?"* ‚Äî **Here's a 5-steps-guide on what to look for:**

1 - Spot the symbols on product labels. There are a few different vegan symbols, like V-label from the European Union (always check ingredients with this one since it can denote both vegan and vegetarian products), the Vegan Society vegan trademark, and the certified vegan symbol. The vegan bunny means that the product is both vegan and cruelty-free.  

2 - Vegan often, although not always, means cruelty-free (and vice-versa). 
If you want to ensure that a product does not test on animals and this is not indicated on the label, check the company‚Äôs website.  

3 - Avoid animal and insect-derived ingredients such as beeswax, honey, lanolin, collagen, gelatin, elastin, keratin, silk proteins, and amino acids, carmine, oleic acid, squalene, guanine, casein, glycerin that is not listed as vegetable glycerin, and casein.  

4 - If a product lists wax as an ingredient, verify that is palm-derived carnauba wax.  

5 - Check out PETA‚Äôs [Beauty Without Bunnies search tool](https://crueltyfree.peta.org/) to find cruelty-free, vegan hair products.

***In a few words, how do you define yourself?***  

A spontaneous, happy, and helpful curlyhead who wants to do too many things at the same time, but still manages to keep up with all of them.  

***Tell us about your background and where you are now?***  

‚ÄãI‚Äôm from the Netherlands, I studied veterinary assistant (nurse) and I have always loved animals. A few months ago, I became vegan. It just felt really weird saying ‚ÄúI love animals‚Äù while drinking a baby cow‚Äôs milk. Ever since I became a vegan, I never wanted to go back. Now I have a job as a veterinary assistant and I live together with my partner. 

***Can you go into detail about your natural hair journey? And share some stuff you've learned in this process?***  

‚ÄãI honestly have no idea how I got into this. I think I found some info on Instagram and got really intrigued. I used to be so strict at the Curly Girl Method. I used no heat, no bad ingredients, no hair dye, no sulfates, and all of that. Since a year or so, I have stopped being so super strict. I use high heat, I use sulfates once a month and I have an appointment to color my hair in June! My hair has still been very healthy, but it‚Äôs just more fun for me to not be so strict.  

I have learned to love my hair in whatever state it is. If it‚Äôs frizzy, stringy, flat, or greasy. There‚Äôs so much pressure and on Instagram, you see a lot of perfect curly hair but you know... it‚Äôs Instagram üòÖ.

***As a digital creator, how do you action your ideas?***  

‚ÄãI usually start with the idea to wash my hair. Then I choose which products I want to use and what I can tell about those products. Then I just go from there and think about the options:  

Comparing gels  
Washday with smooth transitions  
Explaining my routine, and a lot more.  

When I have the idea, I film it and I do it a few times but each time differently just in case if I don‚Äôt like the way it looks.  

***How important is it to you that products are vegan & cruelty-free when partnering with brands?***    

‚ÄãTo be honest I did not care a lot before. I still have a lot of non-vegan products on my shelf. Since I turned vegan, I started caring a lot more. I avoid using non-vegan products and the ones that are tested on animals. If a brand reaches out to me for a collaboration and their products are not vegan nor cruelty-free, then the deal is off.

***Can you share some thoughts on vegan and cruelty-free beauty?***   

I think that most people simply have no idea about the horrifying things that happen to animals to produce a non-vegan (cruelty) product. For example honey, it takes about the lifetime of 8-12 bees to make one teaspoon of honey. People think that animals are supposed to serve us humans because they can‚Äôt stand up for themselves. People think like ‚Äúwell... that‚Äôs just the way it is..‚Äù and proceed to buy non-vegan haircare. 

It takes zero effort to look for vegan AND cruelty-free products. If you do, you‚Äôll make such a big difference for the animals and your hair won‚Äôt even notice it :). You can even change from a silk pillowcase to a satin pillowcase and you‚Äôd save so many silkworms!   

***Do you have any tips to check if a product is vegan or not?***   

Most vegan and cruelty-free brands already have a certification to prove that their products are vegan and cruelty-free. You can always check on https://crueltyfree.peta.org to see if a product is vegan and/or cruelty-free.  

If you‚Äôre not sure, email or DM the brand to ask if their products are vegan and cruelty-free. Some of them don‚Äôt have the certification because it can be found expensive. 
If you still can‚Äôt figure it out you‚Äôre more than welcome to message me.  

***What do you consider the most important step when styling your hair?***  

It has to be wet enough. If it‚Äôs not, you‚Äôll probably get a lot of stringy curls or frizz.  

***We all know it can be tricky to learn how to deal with our hair's texture. For you, what was the most difficult aspect of it?***   

The whole ‚Äúprotein/moisture balance‚Äù was a tough one for me. I have been into moisture overload and protein overload back and forth, haha! It was terrible, but now I‚Äôm just not as strict anymore as I was before and I think that really helped me out.  

***What is the brand you recommend the most?***    

Curly Secret for sure!!! I love ALL of their products. I love how interactive they are with their clients and every time I have a problem with my scalp or anything, they helped me out a lot!   

***If someone starting their curly journey today, asked you for advice, what would you say?***   

1 - Don‚Äôt be too strict on yourself.

2 - You don‚Äôt have to buy a lot of products. If a brand works for you, stick to it and don‚Äôt go in and buy 10 products just because you want to try them out. Your hair is not going to be happy about that.  

3 - Don‚Äôt forget to have fun! It‚Äôs okay if you only deep-conditioned 5 minutes instead of 20 minutes. It‚Äôs okay to use silicones once in a while and it‚Äôs okay if you didn‚Äôt sleep with a satin pillowcase! 

Enjoy the whole process!
