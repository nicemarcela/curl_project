We asked this beauty her hair care routine, she shared her hot tips for moisture + definition for loose waves.  
She has a variety of textures in her hair ranging from 2b waves to 3b spirals. According to her dealing with that can be very tricky:  

"This is very hard to deal with because waves need such different care compared to tighter curls.  
To be honest, I‚Äôm still struggling with this, but what changed the game for me was mousse. I always shied away from it because it didn‚Äôt seem natural but it gives my loose waves the boost and hold to form curls while still moisturizing my tighter clumps.  

I used to think I had to use lots of products on my hair for it to be healthy and defined. But now I find that less is more! I didn‚Äôt know it until I stopped but creams and gels weighed down my hair, even though it‚Äôs thick. With my looser texture, it just needs a little product to ensure moisture and encourage the curl, that‚Äôs what the leave-in and mousse do." 

Scarlett cleanses and styles her hair with As I am Naturally Coconut Co-wash and leave-in. Co-washing is great for keeping your hair moisturized without stripping its natural oils. If you use a cleansing conditioner on your hair, you can wash it more frequently than you may when washing with shampoo, because co-washing is gentler than using harsh detergents. You should co-wash with a conditioning cleanser at least once or twice a week, depending on your texture and the amount of product you tend to style your hair with.  
For deep conditioning, she likes to do DIYs homemade recipes. You can find great recipes for naturally curly hair [here](https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/diy-2/best-diy-recipes-for-naturally-curly-hair).

"As I Am is my favorite brand. It‚Äôs geared more towards tighter textures, but honestly, it works great for my looser curls. It's very moisturizing and always gives me good definition and smells bomb."

#####If someone starting their curly journey today asked you for advice, what would you say?   


"I'd tell them their hair will change. I started with damaged barely 2b hair and now I have curls all over my head. Patience is key, it takes time to transition. Once I did a big chop I was able to start over, so I always recommend a chop or new haircut. Layers are great for looser patterns."

That said, don't freak out you all. Time is key. Trust your process and don't be afraid of a good haircut. üíáüí™‚úÇÔ∏è
